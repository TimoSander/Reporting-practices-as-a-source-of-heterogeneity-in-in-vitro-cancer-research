All cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM; Wako, Osaka, Japan) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; standard medium), 100 µg/ml penicillin, and 100 µg/ml streptomycin. Routine testing confirmed that the cells were free of Mycoplasma and viral contaminants during the entire study period. Bromodeoxyuridine assays A bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) was used to study the effect of TMZ on the proliferation of human GBM cell lines. At a density of 2.5 × 103 cells per well, GBM cells were plated in 96-well plates and cultured with DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS in the presence or absence of TMZ. After 5 days, the rate of BrdU incorporation was examined by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique and the percentage of GBM cells in Sphase was quantified at a wavelength of 450 nm. Thewere regarded as 100% and TMZ-induced decreases in Sphase were expressed as a percentage of the control FBStreated cells. Each assay was performed at least three times.

Cell lines Two human glioblastoma cell lines, U251 and U87, and an immortalized human astrocyte cell line (NHA) were used in this work. All the used lines were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. Cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. At 80% of confluence, the cells were trypsinized and subcultured.

In vitro cytotoxicity studies The efficiency of non-modified and OX26 mAb-modified PLGA NPs in enhancing the antiproliferative effect of TMZ on different human cell lines was evaluated by the Sulforhodamine B (SRB) colorimetric method (Skehan et al., 1990). U251, U87 and NHA cells were seeded at a density of 1000 cells/ well, in 96-well assay plates and incubated for 24 h (37 °C, in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator) to allow complete cell adhesion. Then, TMZ, TMZ-PLGA NPs and mAb-TMZ-PLGA NPs, diluted in DMEM medium at ten final concentrations of TMZ ranging from 0.1 to 800 µM, were added to the cells. After an incubation period of 72 h, the cells were fixed with 10% (w/v) TCA for 1 h at 4 °C, and stained with 0.4% (w/v) SRB dye for 30 min. After repeatedly washing the cells with 1% (v/v) acetic acid to remove unbound dye, the cells air-dried and the proteinbound stain was solubilized with 10 mM Tris solution for UV–VIS absorbance quantification at 560 nm using the (BioTek Synergy HT Microplate Reader, BioTek, UK). The GI50 value – the concentration inhibiting the net cell growth by 50% – for TMZ was calculated from the dose–response curve.

Details regarding the cell lines can be found at https://www.lgcstandards-atcc. org/Products/All/HTB-14.aspx andhttps://www.lgcstandardsatcc.org/Products/All/CRL-1690.aspx. Cell line authentication was performed by ATCC and details regarding characterization methodology are available at http://www.atcc.org/Products/ Cells_and_Microorganisms/Testing_and_Characterization/S TR_Profiling_Analysis.aspx. Cells were cultured under aseptic conditions using Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) (31885-023; Gibco, MD, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FB-1000/500; Biosera, London, UK), 100 units/mL penicillin-streptomycin (15140-122; Gibco, MD, USA) and 2 mM L-glutamine (25030; Gibco). Both cell lines were maintained at standard conditions (37°C and 5% CO2 ) in a humidified atmosphere and were harvested upon reaching 70%–90% confluency. Cytotoxicity assays The AlamarBlue® assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) was used for measuring cytotoxicity. This assay is a reliable method for determining cell viability9 and involves the reduction of resazurin (oxidized form, 7-hydroxy-3Hphenoxazin-3-1-10-oxide) to resorufin by cellular metabolic activity. Next, the number of cells with active mitochondria were counted, given that resazurin reduction is performed by mitochondrial enzymes12. This constitutes a simple, reliable, nontoxic, and safe method of measuring cell viability following irradiation13. After incubating for 7 h, fluorescence was measured using 590 nm as emission wavelength and 530–560 nm as excitation wavelength. Additionally, the culture medium was used as negative control while vitamin C was used as positive control for the full reduction of resazurin. Calculation of the relative fluorescence units and absolute % AlamarBlue reduction has been previously described13-15 . The advantage of the AlamarBlue method is that multiple measurements of the same well can be taken without killing the cells; thus, the viability time course of the same cell population can be monitored up to day 7 when nadir occurs or up to day 12 when there is a clear estimate of regrowth rates. As AlamarBlue is based on mitochondrial function, a disadvantage is that radiation or gene silencing may confound the method’s accuracy by interfering with mitochondrial function and should be excluded. Therefore, cell viability was assessed in parallel using an additional method employing the CyQUANT Cell Proliferation Assay Kit (C7026; Invitrogen), which is based on the fluorescence of a dye bound to cellular nucleic acids16. This assay provides a direct index of DNA content in viable cells attached to the bottom of the plate. However, the assay requires harvesting the cells before measurement, a disadvantage compared to the AlamarBlue assay. Neither radiation nor the siRNAs and short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) employed had any impact on the accuracy of the AlamarBlue assay as it provided identical results to the CyQUANT method. Therefore, data from the AlamarBlue assay are reported herein.",TRUE,81b79753-d59d-42c8-8002-7d70f1dce74c,,FALSE,9629322a-787d-46b2-970a-77d26374c45f,not reported

Cells in the logarithmic growth phase were digested by trypsin before centrifugation. After the supernatant was removed, the cells were resuspended to prepare a cell suspension (5.0 × 104 cells/mL). After a 24-h incubation, 198 μL of culture medium was used to replace the original medium and was added into the cell suspension. After VB was dissolved in DMSO, the gradient concentration of the VB mother liquor (clear solution without precipitation) was obtained after dilution by culture medium. In addition, 2 μL of VB mother liquor at different concentrations (0, 10, 20, 40, 60, 80, or 100 μmol/L) was added into each well. A blank group (the group with only culture medium and no cells) and a negative control group, named the DMSO group (cells treated by 2 μL DMSO), were set. The experiment in each group for each concentration was repeated three times. The DMSO group contained 1% v/v DMSO.

U87 cells were maintained in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium—high glucose (DMEM-HG; Sigma) supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., Waltham, MA, USA), 100 U/ml penicillin (Sigma) and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Sigma). DBTRG cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 (Sigma) supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. NHAs were maintained in DMEM-HG supplemented with 2% (v/v) heat-inactivated FBS, 1% N-2 (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 1% non-essential amino acids (Sigma), 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were cultured at 37◦C under a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Cells were plated 24 h before any experiment. For cell viability evaluation, proliferation assays using SRB and detection of ROS in a f luorescence microplate reader, cells were seeded onto 96- well plates at densities of 0.6 × 104 cells/well (U87) and 0.5 × 104 cells/well (DBTRG cells and NHAs). For qRT-PCR, Western blot analysis, f low cytometry experiments and determination of NOX activity, cells were seeded onto 12-well plates at densities of 0.7 × 105 cells/well (U87) and 0.6 × 105 cells/well (DBTRG cells and NHAs). For f luorescence microscopy studies, cells were seeded onto μ-slide 8-well ibiTreat plates (Ibidi, Planegg, Germany) at densities of 0.2 × 105 cells/well (U87) and 0.17 × 105 cells/well (DBTRG cells). For the analysis of Cers, HexCers, LacCers and sphingomyelins by high-resolution mass spectrometry, cells were plated onto 6-well plates at densities of 1.75 × 105 cells/well (U87 cells) and 1.5 × 105 cells/well (DBTRG cells). Incubation with drugs Cell treatment with the drugs ETO, TMZ, SUN and AXI was performed 48 h after plating. For the drug dose–response experiments, non-transfected cells were incubated with the drugs at different concentrations in complete medium at 37◦C for 24 or 48 h. For studies combining gene silencing with chemotherapy, ETO, TMZ, SUN or AXI was added to the cells 24 h after the time point at which transfection was started. For cells plated onto 96- and 12-well plates, and μ-slide 8-well plates, the added volumes of drug-containing medium were 0.2 ml, 2.376 ml and 0.3 ml, respectively. Cell viability Cell viability was assessed by a modified Alamar Blue assay (39). Brief ly, 200 μl of 10% (v/v) resazurin dye in complete growth medium was added to each well and cells were incubated at 37◦C until the development of a pink coloration. The absorbance of the medium at 570 and 600 nm was measured in a microplate reader (SPECTRAmax PLUS 384, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA), and the cell viability was calculated as a percentage of non-treated cells, according to Eq. (1): Cell viability (% of control) = A570−A600 / A570−A600×100% (1) where A570 and A600 are the absorbances of the samples and A’570 A570 and A’600 A600 are those of the control (non-treated cells), at the indicated wavelengths. Cell proliferation Cell proliferation was measured by the SRB colorimetric assay, as described previously (12, 40). Brief ly, at 24, 48, 72, 96 and 120 h after cell plating onto 96-well plates, cells were fixed by adding trichloroacetic acid (Sigma) to each well, at a final concentration of 10% (w/v), followed by overnight incubation at 4◦C. The solution was then aspirated, and each well was washed with water and completely dried in an oven at 37◦C. Two hundred microliters of 0.057% (w/v) SRB (Sigma) dissolved in 1% acetic acid were added to each well, followed by incubation at 37◦C for 1 h. Unbound SRB was washed out with 1% acetic acid, and the wells were dried. SRB bound to the cells was solubilized with 200 μl of 10 mm Tris base solution, and the absorbance at 510 nm was measured in a microplate reader (SPECTRAmax PLUS 384). Results were expressed with respect to non-treated cells at 24 h or 48 h after plating, which was taken as 100% of cell growth. The incorporation of 5-ethynyl-2 -deoxyuridine (EdU) into cells was also used to measure the proliferation of cells at 96 h after plating by f luorescence microscopy and f low cytometry, as described previously (41), with some modifications. Brief ly, at 4 h before the end of the experiment, cells were treated with 10 μm EdU (Lumiprobe GmbH, Hannover, Germany), which was directly added to the culture medium from a filter-sterile 5 mm EdU stock solution in milliQ water, and incubated at 37◦C.

The IDH1-wildtype U87 and IDH1-mutant U87 cell lines were cultured in DMEM in an incubator with a humidified atmosphere at 37 C containing 5% CO2. 4.2. Therapeutic Agents In Vitro TMZ (Sigma-Aldrich, Co., St, Louis, MO, USA) stock solution was dissolved in DMSO at 100 mM, and the final concentration of all reagents was adjusted by DMEM. There were four treatment groups for each cell line: Bev (provided from Chugai Pharmaceutical, Tokyo, Japan after the material transfer agreement) 500 ng/mL in DMSO (0.5%); TMZ 97 g/mL in DMSO (0.5%); and Bev 500 ng/mL + TMZ 97 g/mL in DMSO (0.5%), and DMSO (0.5%) as the control group. Hanif et al. reported that IC50 growth inhibitory eect of TMZ alone on U87 GBM cells was 0.45 mM [37], thus we used 97 g/mL (approximately equal to 0.5 mM) of TMZ in vitro. Based on the article by Mesti et al. [38], we determined the concentration of Bev in vitro to be 500 ng/mL.  4.4.

The initial stocks were expanded, frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen. Fresh aliquots were thawed every 6 weeks. All cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM; GIBCO, Invitrogen, Paisley, U.K.) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; GIBCO, Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY, U.S.A.), 100 IU/ml penicillin (GIBCO, U.K.), 100 g/ml streptomycin (GIBCO, U.K.), 4 mM glutamine (GIBCO, U.S.A.) and 1 mM sodium pyruvate (GIBCO, U.S.A.), and were incubated at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. CELL VIABILITY ASSAYS  In order to examine cellular proliferation, 3-[4, 5-dimethylthiazol2-yl]-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assays were performed. For MTT assays, 1.5 x 103  cells/well were seeded in 96-well flatbottomed plates and allowed to attach overnight at 37°C prior to changing the medium to DMEM supplemented with 1.5% FBS and antibiotics. Subsequently, the cells were treated with reagents or corresponding solvents. At the indicated time points, the medium was aspirated, and 100 l MTT solution were added to the wells prior to incubation for 3 h at 37°C. The reaction was stopped by adding 100 l of 100% isopropanol (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, U.S.A.), and the optical density (OD) was measured at 550 nm using an automated microplate reader (ELx800, BioTek, Winooski, VT, U.S.A.). Percent viability was expressed as (ODsample-ODblank)/ (ODcontrol-ODblank). Fig. (1). Artesunate [A] enhances the antiproliferative effect of temozolomide [T]. The cellular proliferation of human U87MG and A172 glioblastoma cell lines, following treatment for 144 h with both temozolomide and artesunate or either agent alone, was determined by a MTT assay. In U87MG and A172 cells, treatment with both agents at IC50 and IC25 yielded an enhanced antiproliferative effect when compared to single-agent treatment. However, this effect was most pronounced in A172 cells when treated at IC50.

Tus, U87 is still used as cell model of GBM. To ensure the integrity of our research results, the U87 cell lines were used less than 35 passages from the original obtained from ATCC, and were authenticated by STR profling (Mission Biotech, Taiwan). Cells were maintained in DMEM with 10% FBS at 37 °C in a humidifed 5% CO2 atmosphere. To develop TMZ-resistant (TR) cells, U373 cell line was initially cultured in the presence of 6.25µM of TMZ. Te concentration of TMZ was increased by 2-fold for every two weeks (about four passages) until it reached 50µM (maximum concentration) for over a month. To select the stable TR-U373 clone, the trypan blue exclusion method was used to investigate cell viability and proliferation, and the TR-U373 cell was used when it’s growth rate approximate to normal U373.

U87 cells were maintained in DMEM (Sigma) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS (Gibco, Paisley, Scotland), 100 U/ml penicillin (Sigma), 100 mg/ml streptomycin (Sigma), 12 mmol/l sodium bicarbonate and 10 mmol/l HEPES. DBTRG cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 (Sigma) supplemented with 10% heatinactivated FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin, and 12 mmol/l sodium bicarbonate. Cells were cultured in adherent conditions at 37 C under a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. For all experiments, U87 and DBTRG cells were seeded in multiwell plates at the densities of 1.8x104 cells/ml and 1.6x104 cells/ml, respectively.    Cell viability was evaluated by a modified Alamar blue assay (56). Briefly, 48h after miRNA mimic transfection, cells were incubated in the appropriate culture media with 15 lM sunitinib, 5 lM axitinib or 200 lM temozolomide for 24 h, after which 10% (v/v) resazurin was added to culture media. After 1 h of incubation at 37 C, the absorbance of the medium was measured at 570nm (reduced form) and 600nm (oxidized form) in a microplate reader (SpectraMaxPlus 384, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, USA). Cell viability was calculated as percentage of control cells using the equation: [(A570nm–A600nm) treated cells/ (A570nm–A600nm) control cells] x 100. Cell proliferation assay Cell proliferation was measured in terms of the cellular protein content using the sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay, as previously described (57). Briefly, cells plated onto 96-well plates were fixed by adding 100 ml cold 10% (m/v) trichloroacetic acid to each well, followed by incubation at 4 C. The solution was then aspirated and the wells were dried before the addition of 150 ml 0.05% (w/v) SRB solution containing 1% acetic acid. After 1h incubation at 37 C, the unbound dye was removed by washing with a solution of 1% acetic acid in water. Finally, after drying the wells, 200 ml of 10mM Tris base (pH 10) were added to each well followed by 30 min incubation at room temperature under gentle agitation to solubilize the bound protein stain. The optical density was read at 540nm in a microplate reader (SpectraMaxPlus 384, Molecular Devices).

The cell lines have been tested and authenticated before the experiments were established by the Promega PowerPlex 16 HS and analyzed using the 3130xl Genetic Analyzer (Life Technologies) and GeneMapper IDX software U251-MG and U87-MG were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Normal human astrocytes (NHA) served as controls and were cultured in Astrocyte Basal Medium (ABM; Lonza) supplemented with 0.1% rhEGF, 0.25% insulin, 0.25% ascorbic acid, 0.1% GA1000, 1% L-glutamine, 3% FBS and 1% penicillin/ streptomycin. All the cell lines were cultured at 37°C, in a humidified 5% CO2  atmosphere. Treatment regimen and cell viability assays Our experiments consisted of four arms: no treatment, DMSO + ZnCl2  control, TMZ (Sigma) treatment alone, and TMZ + ZnCl2  (Sigma) combined treatment. Cells were seeded in triplicate 24 hours before treatment, in order to allow for full cell adherence. On day 2, only the cells of DMSO and ZnCl2  control and TMZ and ZnCl2  combination treatment exposed to 100μM ZnCl2  for U251-MG cell line and to 75μM ZnCl2  for U87-MG cell line. TMZ was dissolved in DMSO at 25 or 50μM before treatment and added at day 3. Thereafter, the plates were incubated for 48 or 109 hours based on a time curve for maximum effect. Different concentrations (25, 50 and 100 μM) of TMZ and ZnCl2  were tested before we chose the lowest amount of TMZ with the most effect on cells as lower TMZ treatment will also be important in reducing the side effects of treatment in future. For ZnCl2  we chose the concentration which is not toxic to normal astrocytes and glioma cells by itself and has the most effect on glioma cells in combination with TMZ. Cell viability was determined by cell counting, MTT assay (Sigma) and colony formation assay. For cell counting, 0.25×104  cells were seeded into 6-well plates. 109 hours after the TMZ (50 μM) and ZnCl2  combined treatments, the number of cells were evaluated by suspension of cells in Trypan Blue dye (Biological Industries) and then counting with a hemocytometer in a light microscope. For the MTT assay, 0.8×103  cells were plated in 96-well plates and treated with TMZ (50 μM) and ZnCl2 . After the treatment, as described in the treatment regimen, each well was supplemented with the MTT reagent (5mg/ ml PBS) at a volume of 10% of the medium and incubated for 3 hours at 37°C, in a humidified 5% CO2  atmosphere. Thereafter, 100μl of 0.04 M HCl in absolute isopropanol was added and then the plate was incubated for a further 15 minutes. Absorbance values were measured in an ELISA Reader at 560 and 650 nm. For colony formation assays, the cells were seeded in 6-well plates (0.8 × 103  cells cells per well) and treated according to the regimen with 3 sequential treatments of TMZ (25 μM) and ZnCl2  combination. 14 days after plating, the medium was removed, the cells were washed with PBS and 750 μl 0.5% in ethanol crystal violet (Sigma) was added for 10 minutes at RT (room temperature). The plates were then rinsed extensively in tap water, dried and photographed with a light microscope.

In p53 reporter gene assays LN229 showed superior transcriptional activity compared to U87-MG. The cell lines were cultured in DMEM (Dulbecco’s modified Eagle Medium; Biochrom, Berlin, Germany) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS; Biochrom) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich GmbH, Munich, Germany); they were maintained in culture at 378C with 5% CO2 and 95% humidity and passaged weekly. As chromosomal alterations and changes in chromosome distribution as detected by FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization) were shown to increase in cell cultures over time, no cells above passage 15 were used for the experiments to ensure comparable results. The U87-MG cell line was characterized by a doubling time of 35 þ/7 5 hours and a plating efficiency (PE) of 0.047 +0.024, whereas LN229 demonstrated a doubling time of 27.7 þ/7 1.1 hours and a PE of 0.44+ 0.17 for LN 229. For irradiation cells were grown as log-phase cultures: For carbon ion radiation at the synchrotron (SIS), cells were grown in 12.5 cm2 flasks; for X-ray experiments, culture flasks of 25 cm2 were used. For carbon ion radiation at the Universal Linear Accelerator (UNILAC), cells were grown in 35 mm diameter Petri dishes. The different flasks and petri dishes were required due to the experimental settings at the RT facility at the Gesellschaft fu¨ r Schwerionenforschung (GSI) in Darmstadt, Germany, as described previously (Kraft-Weyrather et al. 1989, Scholz et al. 1997, Weyrather et al. 1999). For the experiments, cells were seeded in culture flasks 48 h prior to the experiment to achieve a density of 8–10 6103 /cm2 at the time point of RT. After irradiation, clonogenic survival was assessed by colony forming assay according to standard procedures. The number of cells plated was chosen to yield about 30 (U87-MG) or 80 (LN229) colonies per flask. After an incubation period of 10 (LN229) to 12 (U87) days after plating cells were fixed with Carbon ion radiotherapy and temozolomide in glioma cells 127 ethanol for 15 min and stained with methylene blue (Sigma-Aldrich GmbH). Colonies with more than 50 cells were counted as survivors. TMZ was kindly provided by Schering-Plough, Kenilworth, New Jersey, USA. It was dissolved in Dimethylsulfoxid (DMSO, Sigma-Aldrich) with final concentrations not exceeding 0.5% of DMSO (Pera et al. 1995). According to a dose-response-relationship reported previously TMZ concentrations of 10 mM and 20 mM were implemented with an incubation time of 4 h (Combs et al. 2007). After incubation with TMZ the medium was removed, cells were rinsed two times with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and then fresh medium was added. The cells were then transferred either to irradiation or back to the incubator. It is known that TMZ leads to G2/M arrest (Hirose et al. 2001). To investigate the influence of a possible G2/M block induced by TMZ on cell survival with and without radiation, in a subset of experiments, we irradiated the TMZ-treated cell cultures 48 h after incubation with TMZ.

Cell culture and exposure groups Human glioblastoma cells from the U87 and T98G lines (Pasteur Institute, Tehran, Iran) were cultured in 25 cm2 flasks (Iwaki, Tokyo, Japan) at a cell density of 4 104 cells/ml in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM; Invitrogen Inc. Gibco BRL, Gaithersburg, MD, USA). The cultures were supplemented with 10% (v/v) inactivated fetal calf serum and 1% (v/v) of penicillin/ streptomycin and maintained in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 0.5 C. The medium was replaced every day. Cell cultures with 80% confluence were routinely trypsinized and split 1:3. Groups of 4 104 cells underwentfor 72, 96,120 or 144 h: 1) no treatment, 2) treatment with 100mM TMZ alone, 3) exposure to a 100 Hz, 100 G EMF alone, or 4) a combination of the TMZ and EMF treatments. Morphological and biochemical investigations were performed after each treatment. 2.1.3. TMZ treatment TMZ is approved for the treatment of high-grade glioma at an administrating dose of 150–200 mg/m2 /day for 5 days every 28- day cycle (i.e., standard 5-day regimen) [25]. Thus, a 261.90 mM TMZ (Schering-Plough, Kenilworth, NJ, USA) stock solution was prepared by dissolving the drug in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and then stored at 80 C. Fresh 50, 100 and 200mM TMZ solutions were obtained by diluting the stock solution with culture medium. DMSO is diluted more than 1000 times when 200mM TMZ is used, thus preventing adverse cellular effects. Alonso et al. [34] showed that the IC50 of TMZ on U87 cells, after 7 days of drug administration, was 204mM, while IC50 of TMZ on T98G cells after 48 h was 500mM [33]. According to the approved TMZ treatment of recurrent high-grade glioma [35], to a person of 170 cm  70 kg, with a body surface area of 1.8 m2 , should be administered 0.15 g/m2 /day  1.8 m2 = 0.27 g/day of TMZ, which corresponds to a concentration in the blood (8% of body weight and a specific weight of 1.055 kg/l) of 261.99mM (TMZ molar mass = 194.15 g/mol). Thus, taking account of these two TMZ values, the highest concentration used in our experiment was 200mM TMZ. Ostermann et al. [36] found that TMZ concentration-time curve in cerebrospinal fluid was 20% of that in plasma, which in this case corresponds to an average TMZ concentration of about 50mM [(204 + 261.99mM)  0.2)/2 = 46.60mM]. Thus, 50mM TMZ was chosen as the lowest value. A 200 mM TMZ (Schering-Plough, Kenilworth, NJ, USA) stock solution was prepared in DMSO and stored at 80 C. Fresh 50, 100 and 200mM TMZ solutions were obtained by diluting the stock solution with culture medium.   2.2.1. 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay The percentage of viable cells was indirectly determined by MTT dye reduction, in which MTT was reduced by active mitochondria in living cells [37]. The MTT assay was performed according to the modified method presented by Sladowski et al. [38]. Briefly, 2 102 cells were incubated in 96-well plates (Iwaki) with 1 mg/ml of MTT in DMEM at 37 C and 5% CO2 for 2 h.

Cells (1x104/ml) were seeded in quadruplicates in 24 well-plates in the presence or absence of several concentrations of the tested drugs alone or in combination. Imatinib was combined with each one of the following psychotropic drugs: fluoxetine, perphenazine, sertraline or temozolomide. Temozolomide was combined with perphe-nazine or sertraline. Cells were cultured for seven days and proliferation was assessed by the SRB assay (24). Briefly, cells were fixed with 10% trichloroacetic acid and stained with 0.4% sulphorhodamine B dissolved in 1% acetic acid. Unbound dye was removed by four repeated washes with acetic acid (1%), and the dye-stained protein was extracted with unbuffered Tris base (10 mM). The absorbance of the stained protein samples at 550 nm was determined, using a 96 well microtiter ELISA plate reader (PowerWave X, Bio Tek Instruments, Inc., USA). The inhibitory effect of each agent added to the cultures was calculated as follows: Inhibition (%) = [1- (OD of treated wells/OD of control wells)] x100.

Ia and Ib are the measured inhibitory effect (%) of each agent acting alone as compared with that of the control cultures. This equation was derived, assuming that the inhibitory agents act independently on the same target population.

Both GBM cell lines were maintained in culture at 37 C, under a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Cells were grown in Dulbecco modified Eagle’s medium – high glucose (DMEM–HG; Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA), supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS; Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA), 100 units/mL penicillin (Sigma) and 100 lg/mL streptomycin (Sigma). GBM cells grown in monolayer were detached using enzyme-free cell dissociation buffer at 50–70% confluence. For flow cytometry, QRT-PCR experiments and Western blot analysis, cells were plated at a density of 7  104 cells/well, in 1 mL of complete medium supplemented with FBS (10% v/v), in 12-well culture plates. For the assays involving the use of chemotherapeutical drugs (temozolomide and etoposide), cells were seeded at a density of 6  103 cells/well, in 100 lL of complete medium, in 96-well plates. In order to determine whether survivin silencing sensitized U87 cells to chemotherapeutic agents, 24 h post-transfection, the medium was replaced by fresh medium and the drugs temozolomide (400 lM) and etoposide (1.5 lM), prepared in DMEM, were added to the cells. After 48 h of incubation of non-transfected and transfected cells with the drugs, cell viability was evaluated by the Alamar blue assay. Cell viability after gene silencing or after gene silencing plus drug incubation was assessed by a modified Alamar blue assay, as previously described [34]. An appropriate volume of resazurin dye in DMEM–HG medium (10% v/v) was added to the cells 48 h after transfection or incubation with the chemotherapeutic drugs.

Human GBM primary cell line (MU1454) was harvested from a surgically resected, pathologically confirmed specimen of a patient of Dr. Litofsky, Division of Neurological Surgery, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO, USA. This primary cell culture was established following the ethical procedures as outlined in the IRB protocol approved by the University of Missouri Institutional Review Board (#1044138).

Initially, the effect of the antioxidants on the viability of U87-MG and MU1454 were studied after 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h of treatment to determine an effective dosing schedule for the anti-oxidants. Later studies focused on pre-treatment at 72 h when it was determined that the maximum effects could be attained at this end point. Cells were plated when the flask confluency reached 95% or greater. After determining the cell count with a hemocytometer, cells were plated at a density of 3 × 103 cells per well into a Falcon 96-multiwell plate and left to incubate for 24 h (Cat no. 353072, Becton Dickinson Labware, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). Cells were treated and cultured using Vitamin D3 at concentrations of 1 nM, 10 nM, and 100 nM, Lipoic Acid at concentrations of 100 nM, 250 µM, and 1 mM, and Melatonin at concentrations of 1 mM, 1 µM, and 50 nM. Dosages were determined from published LC50 values and working dosages in the literature that could approximate natural physiologic levels if taken orally [19–24]. Cell proliferation was evaluated by the MTT assay, as previously described [25]. Briefly, the cells were cultured in 96-well plates and incubated with 10 µL of MTT (12 mM) in a CO2 incubator for 4 h. A total of 100 µL of SDS-HCl solution was added to each well and returned to the CO2 incubator for 4 h, at which time the optical density at 570 nm was measured using a microplate reader (ELx-800, BioTek, Winooski, VT, USA). MTT assays were performed on a total of fifteen wells per treatment(s) per cell line and the experiment was repeated in triplicate. In order to determine if the previous drugs have an antagonistic or synergistic effect with Temozolomide, a second study was performed. Cells were plated as described above and at 24 h, the cultures were treated with Melatonin, Lipoic, or Vitamin D3 at the dosages described above.

U-87 MG, the human glioblastoma cell line was obtained from Korea cell line bank (cat. no. 30014). The U-87 MG cell line distributed by most cell collections (including the American Type Culture Collection, CLS and ECACC) is not the original glioblastoma cell line established in 1968 at the University of Uppsala, but the gene expression profile generated by the ATCC authentication indicates that this cell line is most probably also a glioblastoma cell line but whose origin is unknown (46). To ensure a human cell line for research, the STR profile of U‑87 MG KCLB cell line was authenticated by comparing an STR profile of U-87 MG ATCC using the ATCC database. STR markers of U-87 MG KCLB cell line were identical to those of the accession no. CVCL-0022 of the U-87 MG ATCC cell line.

PrimaPure HDFs were purchased from Genlantis (San Diego, CA). GBM cells lines and HDFs were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and fibroblast growth medium, respectively, at 37°C in a 5% CO2 environment according to manufacturer instructions. Cell death studies U87MG, U118MG and HDF cells were seeded in a 24-well plate at a density of 0.5 x 105 /well. GBM cells were under starvation (serum-free condition) overnight prior to drug exposure. PROG (P3972, Sigma Chemicals, St. Louis, MO) and TMZ (34219; Sigma) stock was prepared in absolute dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and further diluted in culture medium. The final concentration of DMSO was kept at <5μl/ml. Cells were exposed to different concentrations of PROG (0.1, 1, 5, 10, 20, 40, 80 μM), TMZ (5, 10, 25, 50, 75, 100, 200 μM) and their combinations repeatedly for 3 and 6 days. For repeated exposure, culture medium was replaced daily and the drugs were added to the medium every day. Cell viability was measured at days 4 and 7. Concentrations for PROG and a repeated exposure protocol were selected from our previously published work, where we performed separate dose-response studies for PROG against human neuroblastoma and GBM tumors in nude mice after observing PROG’s beneficial effects at high doses in cell culture [12]. For TMZ, we selected the doses from previously published articles [19–22]. MTT reduction assay GBM cell viability was assessed by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay as previously described [13]. The MTT assay is a standard, widely used method of measuring cell death/proliferation [23–26]. The reaction is based on the cleavage of the tetrazolium ring of the pale yellow MTT into dark blue formazan crystals by mitochondrial dehydrogenase enzyme in viable cells. Formazan crystals accumulate within the cells due to their impermeability to the cell membrane and are then solubilized by adding DMSO (50 ml). The intensity of blue formazan solution is directly proportional to the number of surviving cells. Concentrations were determined by photometric analysis. Briefly, 20 μl of MTT solution (5 mg/ml phosphate buffered saline (PBS)) was added per well and incubated at 37°C for 4 h until a purple precipitate was visible. DMSO (500 μl) was added to solubilize the crystals and the absorbance was read at 570 nm.",TRUE,3839bb34-3323-4186-89ca-d2eaf2021f29,,FALSE,17d28743-73b4-442b-9608-8ddbac439800,All data were expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD).

Authentication of cell lines has been performed by ATCC and details in methods of characterization are available at http://www.atcc.org/Products/ Cells_and_Microorganisms/Testing_and_Characterization/STR_ Profiling_Analysis.aspx. Cells were cultured under aseptic conditions using DMEM basal medium (31885e023, Gibco, USA) supplemented with 10% Foetal Bovine Serum (FB-1000/500, Biosera, UK), 100 units/ml Penicillin and 100 mg/ml Streptomycin (15140e122, Gibco, USA) and 2 mM LGlutamine (25030, Gibco, USA). Both cell lines were maintained at standard conditions (37 C, 5%CO2) in humidified atmosphere and were used upon reaching 70e90% confluence.  2.5. Viability assay The AlamarBlue® assay (ThermoScientific, USA) was used to assess cancer cell viability following exposure to drugs and radiation, a method previously validated by our group [12]. This assay, uses the metabolic activity of cells to reduce resazurin (oxidized form; 7-hydroxy-3H-phenoxazin-3-1-10-oxide) to resorufin [13]. The resultant fluorescence of the reduced and the oxidized form, is measured at 590 nm emission wavelength with an excitation at 530e560 nm. This assay is simple and non-toxic method of cell viability, that is measured without demanding fixation of cells, so that these can continue their growth for further experimentation. Cancer cells (controls or treated with drugs or radiation) were plated in a 96- well plate, in culture medium, at a concentration of 250 cells/well. 10% v/v of AlamarBlue® was added in each well. Culture medium without cells was used as a negative control (background measurement). In addition, Vitamin C was used as a positive control for full reduction of resazurin (5ml/well). Then, the relative fluorescence (in RFU units: background fluorescence subtracted by fluorescence of each well) was measured after 6 h, in a FLUOstar® Omega microplate reader (BMG LABTECH GmbH, Ortenberg, Germany).

After all treatments, cells were washed with drug-free medium and allowed to grow for 48 h. 5.5. Trypan blue dye exclusion test for cell viability Following all treatments the viability of attached and detached cell populations was evaluated by trypan blue dye exclusion test. Cells were harvested with trypsin/EDTA, suspended in PBS and mixed with an equal amount of 0.4% trypan blue stain (Invitrogen) after all treatments. The number of cells excluding trypan blue, representing viable cells, was then counted. Viable cells maintained membrane integrity and did not take up trypan blue. Cells with compromised cell membranes took up trypan blue, and were counted as dead. Cells were counted in four different fields and the number of viable cells was calculated as percentage of the total cell population. The count for non-treated cells was considered 100%.

Cytotoxicity Assay The effects of ascorbic acid (1000 µM), temozolomide (100 µM) and etoposide (25 µM) agents alone, in dual and triple combinations on the viability of glioblastoma cell line (U87MG) were studied after 48, 96 and 144 hours of treatment in triplicate. Cells were seeded into 24-well plates in a volume of 500 μl per well at a density of 100,000 cells/well and grown at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO2  incubator. Cell proliferation was measured by a quantitative colorimetric assay using MTT (3). The data was expressed as a percentage of control. MTT (Sigma Cat No:M5655) powder was dissolved in PBS at the concentration of 1 mg/ml. Single agent and dual and triple combinations of ascorbic acid (1000 µM), temozolomide (100 µM) and etoposide (25 µM)-added cells were incubated for 48, 96 and 144 hours at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. After the incubation period, growth medium was removed and 400 μL MTT solution (1 mg/ml) was added to each well. They were incubated for nearly 1 hour until purple precipitates became visible. After the development of visible purple precipitates, each well was filled with 1000 μL dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and isopropanol (1:5) mixture. Plates were incubated for nearly 1 hour until the purple precipitate completely dissolved. Dissolved formazan crystals of each well were measured at 570 nm in the spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-VIS, UVmini-1240).

The methods for culturing patient-derived GBM cell line G131212 were described previously [21]. TMZ-resistant cell lines were generated by iterative pulse exposure of U87-MG and G131212 GBM cells to TMZ. The derived resistant cell lines were designated as U87-MG/TMZ and G131212/TMZ, respectively. Meanwhile, a stock solution of TMZ (100 mM; cat. no. T2577; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) was dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO; cat. no. D2650; Sigma-Aldrich) and stored at − 20 °C. 3-Methyladenine (3-MA; cat. no. M9281; Sigma-Aldrich) was prepared freshly in DMEM at 60 °C and then diluted to 5 mM before use. Cell viability assay Cell viability was assessed by using MTT assays. First, cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 8000 cells per well. After an overnight incubation, the cells were treated under the indicated conditions. At the end of the treatment, 0.5 mg/mL MTT was added to each well and incubated for 4 h. Then, the supernatants were aspirated carefully, and formazan crystals were dissolved in DMSO.
