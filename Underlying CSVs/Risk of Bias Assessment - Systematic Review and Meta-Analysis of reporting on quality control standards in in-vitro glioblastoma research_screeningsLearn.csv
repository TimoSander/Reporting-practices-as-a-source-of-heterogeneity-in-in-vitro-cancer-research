0128a0c2-fce2-439a-a7fa-eec5370f922f,Silencing SATB1 overcomes temozolomide resistance by downregulating MGMT expression and upregulating SLC22A18 expression in human glioblastoma cells,2018,Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common malignant tumor of the central nervous system and has a very poor prognosis. Currently patients were treated by resection followed by radiotherapy plus concurrent temozolomide (TMZ) chemotherapy. However many patients are resistant to TMZ-induced DNA damage because of upregulated expression of the DNA repair enzyme O-6 -methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT). In this study upregulation of SATB1 and MGMT and downregulation of SLC22A18 resulted in acquisition of TMZ resistance in GBM U87 cells. Inactivation of special AT-rich sequence-binding protein 1 (SATB1) using short hairpin RNA (shRNA) downregulated MGMT expression and upregulated solute carrier family 22 member 18 (SLC22A18) expression in GBM cells. This suggested SATB1-mediated posttranscriptional regulation of the MGMT and SLC22A18 protein levels. Immunohistochemical analysis of malignant glioma specimens demonstrated a significant positive correlation between the levels of MGMT and SATB1 and a negative correlation between the levels of SLC22A18 and SATB1. Importantly in recurrent compared with the primary lesions in 15 paired identical tumors the SATB1 and MGMT protein levels were increased and the SLC22A18 levels were decreased. Finally in TMZ-resistant GBM SATB1 knockdown enhanced TMZ efficacy. Consequently SATB1 inhibition might be a promising strategy combined with TMZ chemotherapy to treat TMZ-resistant GBM.,,Sheng-Hua ,,10.1038/s41417-018-0040-3,,Is this publication relevent to this project?,
048e1a11-033d-42ae-9dd8-ace6676979b7,Fever-Range Hyperthermia vs. Hypothermia Effect on Cancer Cell Viability Proliferation and HSP90 Expression,2015,Purpose The current study examines the effect of fever-range hyperthermia and mild hypothermia on human cancer cells focusing on cell viability proliferation and HSP90 expression. Materials and Methods A549 and H1299 lung carcinoma MCF7 breast adenocarcinoma U87MG and T98G glioblastoma DU145 and PC3 prostate carcinoma and MRC5 normal fetal lung fibroblasts cell lines were studied. After 3-day exposure to 34 degrees C 37 degrees C and 40 degrees C cell viability was determined. Cell proliferation (ki67 index) apoptosis (Caspase 9) and HSP90 expression was studied by confocal microscopy. Results Viability/proliferation experiments demonstrated that MRC5 fibroblasts were extremely sensitive to hyperthermia while they were the most resistant to hypothermia. T98G and A549 were thermo-tolerant the remaining being thermo-sensitive to a varying degree. Nonetheless as a universal effect hypothermia reduced viability/proliferation in all cell lines. Hyperthermia sharply induced Caspase 9 in the U87MG most thermo-sensitive cell line. In T98G and A549 thermo-tolerant cell lines the levels of Caspase 9 declined. Moreover hyperthermia strongly induced the HSP90 levels in T98G whilst a sharp decrease was recorded in the thermo-sensitive PC3 and U87MG cell lines. Hyperthermia sensitized thermo-sensitive cancer cell lines to cisplatin and temozolomide whilst its sensitizing effect was diminished in thermo-tolerant cell lines. Conclusions The existence of thermo-tolerant and thermo-sensitive cancer cell lines was confirmed which further encourages research to classify human tumor thermic predilection for patient stratification in clinical trials. Of interest mild hypothermia had a universal suppressing effect on cancer cell proliferation further supporting the radio-sensitization hypothesis through reduction of oxygen and metabolic demands.,,I ,,10.1371/journal.pone.0116021,,Is this publication relevent to this project?,
07c00b6a-d780-4048-9fc7-e989e7de8bdc,MicroRNA-21 silencing enhances the cytotoxic effect of the antiangiogenic drug sunitinib in glioblastoma,2013,Highly malignant glioblastoma (GBM) is characterized by high genetic heterogeneity and infiltrative brain invasion patterns and aberrant miRNA expression has been associated with hallmark malignant properties of GBM. The lack of effective GBM treatment options prompted us to investigate whether miRNAs would constitute promising therapeutic targets toward the generation of a gene therapy approach with clinical significance for this disease. Here we show that microRNA-21 (miR-21) is upregulated and microRNA-128 (miR-128) is downregulated in mouse and human GBM samples a finding that is corroborated by analysis of a large set of human GBM data from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Moreover we demonstrate that oligonucleotide-mediated miR-21 silencing in U87 human GBM cells resulted in increased levels of the tumor suppressors PTEN and PDCD4 caspase 3/7 activation and decreased tumor cell proliferation. Cell exposure to pifithrin an inhibitor of p53 transcriptional activity reduced the caspase activity associated with decreased miR-21 expression. Finally we demonstrate for the first time that miR-21 silencing enhances the antitumoral effect of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor sunitinib whereas no therapeutic benefit is observed when coupling miR-21 silencing with the first-line drug temozolomide. Overall our results provide evidence that miR-21 is uniformly overexpressed in GBM and constitutes a highly promising target for multimodal therapeutic approaches toward GBM.,,C ,,10.1093/hmg/dds496,,Is this publication relevent to this project?,
0871afe8-8d0e-445d-acfd-73929f5626b2,The effect of silibinin in enhancing toxicity of temozolomide and etoposide in p53 and PTEN-mutated resistant glioma cell lines,2015,Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is an intractable brain tumor associated with poor prognosis and low survival rate. Combination therapy such as surgery radiotherapy and temozolomide is considered standard in overcoming this aggressive cancer despite poor prognosis. There is a need to identify potential agents which may augment the chemo-therapeutic effects of standard drugs such as temozolomide. In this project we evaluated the effects of silibinin a natural plant component of milk thistle seeds to potentiate toxic effects of chemotherapy drugs such as temozolomide etoposide and irinotecan on LN229 U87 and A172 (P53 and phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN)-tumor suppressormutated) glioma cell lines. Data from this work suggest that silibinin was effective in potentiating the cytotoxic efficacy of temozolomide in LN229 U87 and A172 cells. While silibinin reduced survivin protein expression only in LN229 cells its ability to potentiate cytotoxicity of chemo therapy drugs occurred irrespective of survivin protein levels. The data also demonstrated that silibinin potentiated the effect of etoposide and but not irinotecan in LN229 cells. Future research will be required to evaluate the in vivo efficacy of silibinin to delineate its mechanism of action and its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier.,,A ,,NA,,Is this publication relevent to this project?,
0d8c4c21-13c3-49dd-aad0-fe8ff6b014cc,Mitochondria Transcription Factor A: A Putative Target for the Effect of Melatonin on U87MG Malignant Glioma Cell Line,2018,The disruption of mitochondrial activity has been associated with cancer development because it contributes to regulating apoptosis and is the main source of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) is a protein that maintains mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) integrity and alterations in its expression are associated with mitochondrial damage and cancer development. In addition studies have shown that mitochondria are a known target of melatonin the pineal gland hormone that plays an important anti-tumorigenic role. Thus we hypothesized that melatonin decreases the expression of TFAM (RNA and protein) in the human glioblastoma cell line U87MG which disrupts mtDNA expression and results in cell death due to increased ROS production and mitochondrial damage. Our results confirm the hypothesis and also show that melatonin reduced the expression of other mitochondrial transcription factors mRNA (TFB1M and TFB2M) and interfered with mtDNA transcription. Moreover melatonin delayed cell cycle progression and potentiated the reduction of cell survival due to treatment with the chemotherapeutic agent temozolomide. In conclusion elucidating the effect of melatonin on TFAM expression should help to understand the signaling pathways involved in glioblastoma progression and melatonin could be potentially applied in the treatment of this type of brain tumor.,,N ,,10.3390/molecules23051129,,Is this publication relevent to this project?,
114951b1-63ff-447c-bbe4-d292bcba7e3f,Down-Regulation of AQP4 Expression via p38 MAPK Signaling in Temozolomide-Induced Glioma Cells Growth Inhibition and Invasion Impairment,2017,Glioma is the most common and lethal central nervous system tumors. Temozolomide (TMZ) is an effective drug for malignant glioma however the intracellular and molecular mechanisms behind this anti-cancer effect have yet to be fully understood. The aim of the present study was to determine whether TMZ inhibits proliferation invasion of glioma cells in vitro and whether these effects can be mediated through modulation of aquaporin 4 (AQP4) and phosphorylation of the MAPK pathway. The viability of U87 and U251 human glioma cells was evaluated using MTT assay. The cell cycle distribution was detected with flow cytometry. Migration ability and invasion ability were tested by scratch assays and transwell assays respectively. The levels of AQP4 and MAPK were measured using immunoblot analyses. Our results showed that TMZ inhibited proliferation migration and invasion and induced G2/M arrest in U87 and U251 glioma cell lines. These changes were associated with a decrease in the levels of AQP4 expression as well as activation phosphorylated level of p38. Treatment with a p38 chemical activator (anisomycin) resulted in similar effects as TMZ treatment on glioma cells. And p38 chemical inhibitor (SB203580) could block these effects in glioma treated with TMZ suggesting a direct up-regulation of the p38 signaling pathway. Therefore we identified that TMZ might have therapeutic potential for controlling proliferation invasion of malignant glioma by inhibiting AQP4 expression through activation of p38 signal transduction pathway.

116f3a42-5aef-4ae5-96ef-62f8d11f7e55,Inhibition of EZH2 reverses chemotherapeutic drug TMZ chemosensitivity in glioblastoma,2014,Glioblastoma remains among the most devastating cancers with a median survival of less than 15 months and virtually no survival beyond five years. Currently the treatment of glioma includes surgery radiation therapy chemotherapy and comprehensive treatment. Intrinsic or acquired resistance to TMZ is one of the greatest obstacles in successful GB treatment and is thought to be influenced by a variety of mechanisms. The EZH2 gene which is expressed in various solid tumors can regulate gene transcription and promote the generation and progression of tumors. Our aim was to investigate the relationship between EZH2 and multidrug-resistance of human glioblastoma cells. In this study we established TMZ-resistant U251 and U87 clones (U251/TMZ and U87/TMZ cells) which expressed high level of EZH2. Using RNA interference we demonstrated that the downregulation of Ezh2 expression in U251/TMZ and U87/TMZ cells resulted in apoptosis and a cell cycle arrest in the G1/S phase. Furthermore the reduced expression of Ezh2 altered the MDR MRP and BCRP mRNA and protein levels. These findings suggest that EZH2 plays an important part in the development of multidrug resistance and may represent a novel therapeutic target for multidrug-resistant glioblastoma.,,T ,,NA,,Is this publication relevent to this project?,
11e8bff3-47cf-4251-8d23-d92e4ea72620,Combined effect of 2-5A-linked antisense against telomerase RNA and conventional therapies on human malignant glioma cells in vitro and in vivo,2007,We recently showed that therapy with 2'-5'-oligoadenylate (2-5A)-linked antisense against human telomerase RNA component (2-5A-anti-hTR) is a novel telomerase-targeting strategy against malignant gliomas. In this study we investigated conventional chemotherapeutic agents and gamma-irradiation (IR) to determine whether they could augment the efficacy of 2-5A-anti-hTR against these tumors in vitro and in vivo. Treatment with 2-5A-anti-hTR inhibited the viability of U373-MG and U87-MG malignant glioma cells in a dose-dependent manner; the antitumor effect resulted from induction of apoptosis. Also telomerase-positive astrocytes with oncogenic Ras were more sensitive to 2-5A-anti-hTR than were those without oncogenic Ras. In addition we sought to determine the combined effect of 2-5A-anti-hTR with N N'-bis (2-chloroethyl)-N-nitrosourea (BCNU) cisplatin (CDDP) paclitaxel (PTX) temozolomide (TMZ) or IR. When we administered the combination treatments on the same day PTX and IR showed a greater combined effect with 2-5A-anti-hTR on both tumor cell lines than did BCNU CDDP and TMZ. However all of the combination regimens were synergistic when we first treated tumor cells with 2-5A-anti-hTR for 24 h and then exposed them to the conventional treatments. Apoptosis-inducing agents (CDDP and PTX) but not autophagy-inducing therapies (TMZ and IR) enhanced the incidence of apoptosis caused by 2-5A-anti-hTR. Lastly we observed a combinatorial effect of 2-5A-anti-hTR and TMZ in vivo in subcutaneous U87-MG tumors in nude mice. Interestingly treatment with TMZ increased the incidence of apoptosis in subcutaneous tumor cells treated with 2-5A-anti-hTR. These results suggest that 2-5A-anti-hTR is preferable in combination with established cancer therapies.,,S ,,NA,,Is this publication relevent to this project?,
120b32f9-25ae-494f-b94d-c4aaf9b75ee8,TAZ promotes temozolomide resistance by upregulating MCL-1 in human glioma cells,2015,Temozolomide is a novel cytotoxic agent currently used as first-line chemotherapy for glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). However intrinsic or acquired chemoresistance to temozolomide remains the greatest obstacle to the successful treatment of human GBM. The principal mechanism responsible for this resistance is largely unknown. In the present study we showed that expression of transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) in glioma cells correlated with temozolomide chemoresistance in human glioma cells. Overexpression of TAZ promoted temozolomide resistance in U-87MG cells whereas knockdown of TAZ expression sensitized temozolomide-resistant U-251MG cells to temozolomide. Further TAZ inhibits temozolomide induced apoptosis via upregulation of MCL-1 (myeloid cell leukemia 1) and high expression of TAZ predicts a poor prognosis for GBM patients. In conclusion our results suggest that TAZ had a critical role in the resistance to temozolomide in glioma cells and it may provide a promising target for improving the therapeutic outcome of temozolomide-resistant gliomas.,,Zhaoming ,,10.1016/j.bbrc.2015.05.115,,Is this publication relevent to this project?,
125722bc-9306-4620-8c6c-b77e82b7801a,The DNA repair protein ALKBH2 mediates temozolomide resistance in human glioblastoma cells,2013,INTRODUCTION: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM; World Health Organization astrocytoma grade IV) is the most frequent and most malignant primary brain tumor in adults. Despite multimodal therapy all such tumors practically recur during the course of therapy causing a median survival of only 14.6 months in patients with newly diagnosed GBM. The present study was aimed at examining the expression of the DNA repair protein AlkB homolog 2 (ALKBH2) in human GBM and determining whether it could promote resistance to temozolomide chemotherapy. METHODS: ALKBH2 expression in GBM cell lines and in human GBM was determined by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and gene expression analysis respectively. Drug sensitivity was assessed in GBM cells overexpressing ALKBH2 and in cells in which ALKBH2 expression was silenced by small-interfering (si)RNA. ALKBH2 expression following activation of the p53 pathway was examined by western blotting and qRT-PCR. RESULTS: ALKBH2 was abundantly expressed in established GBM cell lines and human GBM and temozolomide exposure increased cellular ALKBH2 expression levels. Overexpression of ALKBH2 in the U87 and U251 GBM cell lines enhanced resistance to the methylating agents temozolomide and methyl methanesulfonate but not to the nonmethylating agent doxorubicin. Conversely siRNA-mediated knockdown of ALKBH2 increased sensitivity of GBM cells to temozolomide and methyl methanesulfonate but not to doxorubicin or cisplatin. Nongenotoxic activation of the p53 pathway by the selective murine double minute 2 antagonist nutlin-3 caused a significant decrease in cellular ALKBH2 transcription levels. CONCLUSION: Our findings identify ALKBH2 as a novel mediator of temozolomide resistance in human GBM cells. Furthermore we place ALKBH2 into a new cellular context by showing its regulation by the p53 pathway.,,Rolf ,,10.1093/neuonc/nos301,,Is this publication relevent to this project?,
15d3833f-f489-41be-b67a-ae8f784143c5,MicroRNA-29b promotes cell sensitivity to Temozolomide by targeting STAT3 in glioma,2020,OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore the effects of microRNA-29b (miR-29b) on chemoresistance of glioma and to examine the underlying mechanisms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: MiR-29b expression in glioma tissues and cell lines was analyzed by quantitative real time-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The cell viability was determined by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay. Cell apoptosis was analyzed by Annexin V-Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) assay. The relationship between miR-29b and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) was examined by the Dual-Luciferase reporter gene assay. The levels of cleaved caspase-3 Bax. Bcl-2 and STAT3 were detected by Western blotting assay. RESULTS: The expression of miR-29b was downregulated in glioma tissues compared to normal brain tissue. In addition the expression level of miR-29b was lower in glioma tissues from patients at late stages (III and IV) compared with early stages (I and II). Besides miR-29b expression was significantly lower in LN229 U87MG and 0251 cells compared to normal human astrocytes (NHA) cells. Moreover our results showed that miR-29b expression in Temozolomide (TMZ)-resistance cell lines U251/TMZ and U87MG/TMZ was markedly lower than that of TMZ-sensitivity cell lines 0251 and U87MG. The protein levels of STAT3 and the phosphorylation of STAT3 were increased in U251/ TMZ and U87MG/TMZ compared to 0251 and U87MG. When the expression of miR-29b was repressed cell viability was increased. Meanwhile cell apoptosis was reduced the protein levels of cleaved caspase-3 and (Bcl-2 Associated X Protein) Bax were decreased whereas the protein level of B-cell lymphoma 2 (BcI-2) was increased. Moreover the effects of miR-29b knockdown on the cell growth and apoptosis in U251 and U87MG cells were markedly attenuated by knockdown of STAT3. In TMZ-resistant U251/TMZ and U87MG/TMZ cells transfection with miR-29b decreased cell growth promoted apoptotic cell death. elevated the protein levels of cleaved caspase-3 and Bax protein while downregulated BcI-2 protein. As expected. the effect of miR-29b upregulation on cell growth and apoptosis of TMZ-resistant glioma cells was reversed by STAT3 overexpression. The results from the Luciferase assay demonstrated miR-29b modulated STAT3 expression by directly bound with 3'-Untranslated Region (3'-UTR). CONCLUSIONS: MiR-29b enhances the cell sensitivity to TMZ by inhibiting STAT3 in glioma. Our study might provide a novel target for treating TMZ-resistant glioma.,,P ,,NA,,Is this publication relevent to this project?,
171da790-f34b-4a9b-97fc-f287a33bdc17,Overexpression of iASPP-SV in glioma is associated with poor prognosis by promoting cell viability and antagonizing apoptosis,2016,Inhibitor of apoptosis-stimulating protein of p53 (iASPP) encoded by PPP1R13L gene is often overexpressed in human cancers. From the PPP1R13L gene at least two isoforms iASPP-L and iASPP-SV are produced through alternative splicing. However the role of these isoforms in glioma is still elusive. In this study we examined the expression of iASPP-SV in astrocytic glioma tissues with different grades and normal human cerebral tissues. The result showed a higher messenger RNA (mRNA) expression level of iASPP-SV in astrocytic glioma patients with World Health Organization (WHO) grade II to IV in comparison to the normal controls. Additionally mRNA expression level of iASPP-SV was gradually increased with the raise of the grade in glioma. High mRNA expression level of iASPP-SV was significantly associated with malignant WHO grades (P < 0.001). The protein expression level of iASPP-SV was consistent with the mRNA expression level. The Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that high iASPP-SV mRNA expression significantly affected overall survival and progression-free survival (both P < 0.001). Furthermore multivariate analysis indicated that the mRNA expression of iASPP-SV was an independent prognostic marker in glioma (P < 0.001). To further explore the role of iASPP-SV in glioma U87 cells were transfected with iASPP-SV by lentivirus and then treated with temozolomide (TMZ). Overexpression of iASPP-SV promoted the cell viability and downregulated the expression of pro-apoptosis genes (Bax Puma p21 and Noxa) to inhibit apoptosis induced by TMZ. Our study provides the first evidence that high iASPP-SV expression may be a novel prognostic factor and therapeutic target for glioma.,,Shangfeng ,,10.1007/s13277-015-4503-y,,Is this publication relevent to this project?,
196d5d53-d76a-44b8-ad24-204e97e4c85d,Lithium enhances the antitumour effect of temozolomide against TP53 wild-type glioblastoma cells via NFAT1/FasL signalling,2017,Background: We previously showed that activation of the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT)1/Fas ligand (FasL) pathway induces glioma cell death. Lithium (Li) is an inhibitor of glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3 that activates NFAT1/FasL signalling. Temozolomide (TMZ) inhibits GSK-3 and activates Fas in tumour protein (TP) 53 wild-type (TP53wt) glioma cells. The present study investigated the combinational effects of TMZ and low-dose Li on TP53wt glioma cells. Methods: The combined effect of TMZ and Li was examined in TP53wt U87 and primary glioma cells and a mouse xenograft model. Results: Combination with 1.2mM Li potentiated TMZ-induced cell death in TP53wt glioma cells as determined by neurosphere formation and apoptosis assays. Temozolomide combined with Li treatment inhibited GSK-3 activation promoted NFAT1 nuclear translocation and upregulated Fas/FasL expression. Targeted knockdown of NFAT1 expression blocked the induction of cell death by TMZ and Li via FasL inhibition. In vivo combined treatment with TMZ and Li suppressed tumour growth and prolonged the survival of tumour-bearing mice. However the combination of TMZ and Li did not produce a statistically significant effect in TP53mut glioma cells. Conclusions: Temozolomide combined with low-dose Li induces TP53wt glioma cell death via NFAT1/FasL signalling. This represents a potential therapeutic strategy for TP53wt glioma treatment.,,Anhua ,,10.1038/bjc.2017.89,,Is this publication relevent to this project?,
1a3864c0-0514-4c27-a8c7-945452e4108c,Receptor-mediated PLGA nanoparticles for glioblastoma multiforme treatment,2018,Glioblastoma multiforme is the most lethal type of brain tumor and the established therapy only extends patients survival to approximately one year. Its first-line treatment is based on of chemotherapy with the alkylating agent temozolomide (TMZ). As many other chemotherapeutic drugs TMZ presents several limitations as high toxicity and low bioavailability. The delivery of TMZ using poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) nanoparticles is proposed in this work. Stable nanoparticles functionalized with a OX26 type monoclonal antibody for transferrin receptor were developed targeting the glioblastoma tumor cells since these cells are known for overexpressing this receptor. The release profile of TMZ from the nanoparticles was studied mimicking physiological conditions and targeted cellular internalization was also investigated. Two glioblastoma cell lines - U215 and U87 - were used to evaluate the in vitro cytotoxicity of the drug showing that the prepared nanocarriers enhance the anticancer activity of TMZ. The functionalization with the monoclonal antibody for transferrin receptor proved to be advantageous in enhancing the cellular internalization in glioblastoma cells.,,C ,,10.1016/j.ijpharm.2018.04.062,,Is this publication relevent to this project?,
1a4c7e09-3206-41bc-a3b8-95aa14be6744,Identification of Key Candidate Proteins and Pathways Associated with Temozolomide Resistance in Glioblastoma Based on Subcellular Proteomics and Bioinformatical Analysis,2018,TMZ resistance remains one of the main reasons why treatment of glioblastoma (GBM) fails. In order to investigate the underlying proteins and pathways associated with TMZ resistance we conducted a cytoplasmic proteome research of U87 cells treated with TMZ for 1 week followed by differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) screening KEGG pathway analysis protein-protein interaction (PPI) network construction and validation of key candidate proteins in TCGA dataset. A total of 161 DEPs including 65 upregulated proteins and 96 downregulated proteins were identified. Upregulated DEPs were mainly related to regulation in actin cytoskeleton focal adhesion and phagosome and PI3K-AKT signaling pathways which were consistent with our previous studies. Further the most significant module consisted of 28 downregulated proteins that were filtered from the PPI network and 9 proteins (DHX9 HNRNPR RPL3 HNRNPA3 SF1 DDX5 EIF5B BTF3 and RPL8) among them were identified as the key candidate proteins which were significantly associated with prognosis of GBM patients and mainly involved in ribosome and spliceosome pathway. Taking the above into consideration we firstly identified candidate proteins and pathways associated with TMZ resistance in GBM using proteomics and bioinformatic analysis and these proteins could be potential biomarkers for prevention or prediction of TMZ resistance in the future.,,Ya-Wei ,,10.1155/2018/5238760,,Is this publication relevent to this project?,
1a73d1cc-c2b3-4677-ba64-4daa39466b61,Calpain suppresses cell growth and invasion of glioblastoma multiforme by producing the cleavage of filamin A,2020,Background Filamin A is the most widely expressed isoform of filamin in mammalian tissues. It can be hydrolyzed by Calpain producing a 90-kDa carboxyl-terminal fragment (ABP90). Calpeptin is a chemical inhibitor of Calpain which can inhibit this effect. It has been shown that ABP90 acts as a transcription factor which is involved in mediating cell signaling. However the significance of ABP90 and its clinical signature with underlying mechanisms have not been well studied in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Methods ABP90 protein was measured in 36 glioma patients by Western blot. Human GBM cell lines U87 and A172 were used to clarify the precise role of ABP90. CCK-8 assay was used to analyze the cell viability. Transwell invasion assay and wound healing assay were used to analyze the migration and invasion. Expression of matrix metalloproteinase 2/tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2/TIMP2) protein was analyzed by Western blot. Results ABP90 protein expression was lower in GBM tissues. The patients with low ABP90 protein expression had a shorter OS time (p = 0.046). After being treated with Calpain the expression of ABP90 was upregulated which led to a decline of cell viability enhanced the efficacy of temozolomide and restrained the cell invasion. Calpeptin could inhibit the effect. The mechanism might be involved in the balance of MMP2/TIMP2. Conclusions Our present data suggest that ABP90 expression is a significant prognostic factor and may play an important role in cell viability chemotherapeutic sensitivity and invasion of GBM.,,Xianghe ,,10.1007/s10147-020-01636-7,,Is this publication relevent to this project?,
1f254bfe-78d1-48b5-a8de-6c21729eefde,CtIP contributes to non-homologous end joining formation through interacting with ligase IV and promotion of TMZ resistance in glioma cells,2019,OBJECTIVE: C-terminal-binding protein interacting protein (CtIP) participates in a variety of DNA metabolisms and DNA double strand break repair (DSBR). The role of CtIP has been proven in facilitating end resection in homologous recombination (HR). This study aimed to investigate the role of CtIP in non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) formation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study CtIP deficient U87 cell line was generated by using CRISPR/Cas9 method. HR and NHEJ reporter assay were conducted in U87 cells. The cell viability of U87 cells was evaluated by using Sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay. Ionizing radiation assay and clonogenic survival assay were also conducted in this study. Bacteria expressed CtIP and ligase IV proteins were collected and purified. Affinity capture assay was conducted to observe the interactions between proteins. RESULTS: Both of the temozolomide (TMZ)-resistant and CtIP deficient glioma cell lines were successfully generated. The results indicated that CtIP participated in NHEJ formation through interacting with ligase IV in glioma cells. CtIP significantly improved the NHEJ efficiency in glioma cells. The CtIP deficient glioma cells were sensitive to the treatment of DNA damaging drug (TMZ). Meanwhile the CtIP deficiency significantly enhanced the sensitivity of glioma cells to the treatment of TMZ. CONCLUSIONS: The present study indicated that CtIP contributed to NHEJ formation through interacting with IV and promotion of TMZ resistance in glioma cells via promoting DSBR efficiency.,,Y ,,10.26355/eurrev_201903_17252,,Is this publication relevent to this project?,
1f294c6f-6641-4af9-b58f-e8e140ffcb69,Autophagic flux response and glioblastoma sensitivity to radiation,2018,Objective: Glioblastoma is the most common primary brain tumor in adults and one of the most lethal human tumors. It constitutes a unique non-metastasizing human tumor model with high resistance to radiotherapy and chemotherapy. The current study investigates the association between autophagic flux and glioblastoma cell resistance. Method(s): The expression kinetics of autophagy- and lysosome-related proteins following exposure of two glioblastoma cell lines (T98 and U87) to clinically relevant radiation doses was examined. Then the response of cells resistant to radiotherapy and chemotherapy was investigated after silencing of LC3A LC3B and TFEB genes in vitro and in vivo. Result(s): Following irradiation with 4 Gy the relatively radioresistant T98 cells exhibited enhanced autophagic flux. The more radiosensitive U87 cell line suffered a blockage of autophagic flux. Silencing of LC3A LC3B and TFEB genes in vitro significantly sensitized cells to radiotherapy and temozolomide (U87: P < 0.01 and < 0.05 respectively; T98: P < 0.01 and < 0.01 respectively).

Thus this study aimed to investigate the effects of VB on glioblastoma cell proliferation apoptosis migration and invasion as well as the mechanism involving signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and Src homology 2 domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase 1 (SHP-1). Method(s): U87 cells were assigned to different treatments. The MTT assay was used to test cell proliferation flow cytometry was used to detect cell apoptosis and a Transwell assay was used for cell migration and invasion. We analyzed the glioblastoma tumor growth in a xenograft mouse model. Western blot analysis was employed to determine the protein expression of related genes. Result(s): Glioblastoma cells exhibited decreased cell proliferation migration invasion and increased apoptosis when treated with VB or TMZ. Western blot analysis revealed elevated SHP-1 expression and reduced phosphorylated (p)-STAT3 expression in glioblastoma cells treated with VB compared with controls. Correspondingly in a xenograft mouse model treated with VB glioblastoma tumor volume and growth were decreased. Glioblastoma xenograft tumors treated with VB showed elevated SHP-1 Bax cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved PARP expression and reduced p-STAT3 Bcl-2 survivin MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression. siRNA-SHP-1 inhibited the VB effects on glioblastoma. Conclusion(s): This study demonstrates that VB inhibits glioblastoma cell proliferation migration and invasion while promoting apoptosis via SHP-1 activation and inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation.Copyright © 2018 The Author(s).

259ce92d-84a3-4aca-910f-961ea14a36cb,Major Contribution of Caspase-9 to Honokiol-Induced Apoptotic Insults to Human Drug-Resistant Glioblastoma Cells,2020,Temozolomide (TMZ)-induced chemoresistance to human glioblastomas is a critical challenge now. Our previous studies showed that honokiol a major bioactive constituent of Magnolia officinalis (Houpo) can kill human glioblastoma cells and suppresses glioblastoma growth. This study was further aimed to evaluate the effects of honokiol on human drug-resistant glioblastoma cells and the possible mechanisms. The results by data mining in the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) database and immunohistochemistry displayed that expression of caspase-9 mRNA and protein in human glioblastomas was induced. Human TMZ-resistant U87-MG-R9 glioblastoma cells were selected and prepared from human drug-sensitive U87-MG cells. Compared to human drug-sensitive U87-MG cells TMZ did not affect viability of U87-MG-R9 glioblastoma cells. Interestingly treatment with honokiol suppressed proliferation and survival of human drug-resistant glioblastoma cells in concentration- and time-dependent manners. Compared to caspase-8 activation honokiol chiefly increased activity of caspase-9 in U87-MG-R9 cells. Successively levels of cleaved caspase-3 and activities of caspase-3 and caspase-6 in human TMZ-tolerant glioblastoma cells were augmented following honokiol administration. In parallel honokiol triggered DNA fragmentation of U87-MG-R9 cells. Accordingly treatment of human TMZ-resistant glioblastoma cells with honokiol induced cell apoptosis but did not affect cell necrosis. Fascinatingly suppressing caspase-9 activity using its specific inhibitors repressed honokiol-induced caspase-6 activation DNA fragmentation and cell apoptosis. Taken together this study has shown the major roles of caspase-9 in transducing honokiol-induced mitochondria-dependent apoptosis in human drug-resistant glioblastoma cells. Thus honokiol may be clinically applied as a drug candidate for treatment of glioblastoma patients with chemoresistance.,,M ,,10.3390/molecules25061450,,Is this publication relevent to this project?,
26733bf5-d7d8-4df3-8293-968f88aa6fc7,Silence of bFGF enhances chemosensitivity of glioma cells to temozolomide through the MAPK signal pathway,2016,Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) is a multifunctional growth factor in glioma cells and has been proved to be associated with the grade malignancy of glioma and prognosis of patients. Although there is evidence showing that bFGF plays an important role in proliferation differentiation angiogenesis and survival of glioma cells the effect of bFGF on chemosensitivity of glioma has not been verified. In this study we analyzed the relationship between bFGF and chemotherapy resistance with the objective of offering new strategy for chemotherapy of glioma patients. Here siRNA was used to silence the expression of bFGF in glioma cell lines including U87 and U251 followed by chemotherapy of temozolomide (TMZ). Then the characters of glioma including proliferation apoptosis migration and cell cycle were studied in U87 and U251 cell lines. Our results demonstrated that silencing bFGF enhanced the effect of TMZ by inhibiting proliferation and migration blocking cell cycle in G0/G1 and promoting apoptosis. In addition the phosphorylation level of MAPK was measured to explore the mechanism of chemosensitization. The results showed that bFGF could promote the activation of the MAPK signal pathway. Our data indicated that bFGF might be a potential target for chemotherapy through the MAPK signal pathway.,,Jinhuan ,,10.1093/abbs/gmw035,,Is this publication relevent to this project?,

Our previous study reported that gap junctions composed of connexin32 (Cx32) was implicated in the effect of analgesics on cisplatin cytotoxicity. However the effect of analgesic on the most widely expressed connexin (Cx) connexin43 (Cx43) and whether such effect mediates the influence on chemotherapeutic efficiency remain unknown. By manipulation of Cx43 expression or gap junction function we found that there were gap junction-dependent and independent effect of Cx43 on temozolomide (TMZ) sensitivity in U87 glioblastoma cells. Studies on survival and apoptosis showed widely used analgesic tramadol significantly reduced TMZ-induced cytotoxicity in control and negative control cells but not shCx43-transfected cells. Proliferation assay demonstrated tramadol suppressed TMZ-induced cytotoxicity only on high density (with gap junction formation) but not on low density (without gap junction formation). Tramadol inhibited dye-coupling through gap junctions between U87 cells. Tramadol treatment for 72 h did not alter Cx43 expression but decreased Cx43 phosphorylation accompanied with reduced p-ERK and p-JNK. Our results indicated that long-term treatment with tramadol reduced TMZ cytotoxicity in U87 cells by suppressing Cx43-composed gap junctions suggesting identification and usage of antinociceptive drugs which do not downregulate connexin activity should have beneficial therapeutic consequences.,,H ,,10.3892/ijo.2017.4188,,Is this publication relevent to this project?,
282a2419-c7f1-485b-8534-ea69028a569a,FTY720 inhibits the Nrf2/ARE pathway in human glioblastoma cell lines and sensitizes glioblastoma cells to temozolomide,2017,Background Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a redox-sensitive transcription factor regulating the expression of various cytoprotective genes. Constitutive Nrf2 activation in many cancers enhances cell survival and resistance to anti-cancer drugs. Our previous studies have shown that FTY720 induced autophagy-related apoptosis and necroptosis and inhibited invasion and migration in human glioblastoma cells. However whether FTY720 regulated Nrf2 in glioblastoma cells remained unclear. Methods Cell viability assay western blot migration and invasion assay short hairpin RNA (shRNA) were used. Results We found that FTY720 suppressed the protein and mRNA levels of Nrf2 in human U251MG and U87MG glioblastoma cells lines. In addition the protein and mRNA levels of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and NADPH:quinine oxidoreductase-1 (NQO-1) two representative target factors of Nrf2 also decreased upon FTY720 treatment. Knockdown of Nrf2 further promoted the anti-cancer effects of FTY720 while activation of Nrf2 exist the opposite effects. In addition FTY720 significantly sensitized glioblastoma cells to temozolomide (TMZ). However activation of Nrf2 essentially abolished the induced sensitivity by FTY720. Conclusion Our results indicated the potential application of FTY720 in treatment of glioblastoma and demonstrated that inhibition of Nrf2 can enhance the sensitivity of cancer cells to chemotherapeutic drugs.Copyright © 2017 Institute of Pharmacology Polish Academy of Sciences,,H ,,10.1016/j.pharep.2017.07.003,,Is this publication relevent to this project?,

However acquired TMZ resistance represents a major clinical challenge that leads to tumor relapse or progress. This study investigated the genomic profiles including long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) and mRNA expression associated with acquired TMZ resistance in glioblastoma (GBM) cells in vitro. The TMZ-resistant (TR) of GBM sub-cell lines were established through repetitive exposure to increasing TMZ concentrations in vitro. The differentially expressed lncRNAs and mRNAs between the parental U87 and U87TR cells were detected by human lncRNA microarray method. In this study we identified 2 692 distinct lncRNAs demonstrating >2-fold differential expression with 1 383 lncRNAs upregulated and 1 309 lncRNAs downregulated. Moreover 4 886 differential mRNAs displayed 2 933 mRNAs upregulated and 1 953 mRNAs downregulated. Further lncRNA classification and subgroup analysis revealed the potential functions of the lncRNA-mRNA relationship associated with the acquired TMZ resistance. Gene ontology and pathway analysis on mRNAs showed significant biological regulatory genes and pathways involved in acquired TMZ resistance. Moreover we found the ECM-receptor interaction pathway was significantly downregulated and ECM related collagen I fibronectin laminin and CD44 were closely associated with the TR phenotype in vitro. Our findings indicate that the dysregulated lncRNAs and mRNAs identified in this work may provide novel targets for overcoming acquired TMZ resistance in GBM chemotherapy.,,H ,,10.3892/ijo.2017.4033,,Is this publication relevent to this project?,
2b999778-7617-4dff-873a-5c75b39ef45b,Glucosylceramide synthase silencing combined with the receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor axitinib as a new multimodal strategy for glioblastoma,2019,A great deal of evidence revealing that lipid metabolism is drastically altered during tumorigenesis has been accumulated. In this work glucosylceramide synthase (GCS) was targeted using RNA interference technology (siRNAs) in U87 and DBTRG human glioblastoma (GBM) cells as in both cell types GCS showed to be overexpressed with respect to normal human astrocytes. The efficacy of a combined therapy to tackle GBM allying GCS silencing to the new generation chemotherapeutics sunitinib and axitinib or to the alkylating drugs etoposide and temozolomide is evaluated here for the first time. With this purpose studies addressing GBM cell viability and proliferation cell cycle and apoptosis were performed which revealed that combination of GCS silencing with axitinib treatment represents a promising therapeutic approach. The reduction of cell viability induced by this combined therapy is proposed to be mediated by excessive production of reactive oxygen species. This work identifying GCS as a key molecular target to increase GBM susceptibility to a new generation chemotherapeutic opens windows to the development of innovative strategies to halt GBM recurrence after surgical resection.,,S ,,10.1093/hmg/ddz152,,Is this publication relevent to this project?,
2d18cbe5-d2d5-4745-8755-45dfc57e7ac6,Synergistic suppression of noscapine and conventional chemotherapeutics on human glioblastoma cell growth,2013,Aim: Noscapine (NOS) is a non-narcotic opium alkaloid with anti-tumor activity. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of the combination of NOS with conventional chemotherapeutics temozolamide (TMZ) bis-chloroethylnitrosourea (BCNU) or cisplatin (CIS) on human glioblastoma cells. Methods: U87MG human glioblastoma cells were examined. Cell proliferation was quantified using MTT assay. Western blotting and flow cytometry were used to examine apoptosis and the expression of active caspase-3 and cleaved PARP. Mouse tumor xenograft model bearing U87MG cells was treated with TMZ (2 mg.kg(-1).d(-1) ip) or CIS (2 mg/kg ip 3 times a week) alone or in combination with NOS (200 mg.kg(-1).d(-1) ig) for 3 weeks. Immunohistochemistry was used to investigate the expression of active caspase-3 and Ki67 following treatment in vivo. The safety of the combined treatments was evaluated based on the body weight and histological studies of the animal's organs. Results: NOS (10 or 20 mol/L) markedly increased the anti-proliferation effects of TMZ BCNU and CIS on U87MG cells in vitro. The calculated combination index (CI) values of NOS-CIS NOS-TMZ and NOS-BCNU (20 mu mol/L) were 0.45 0.51 and 0.57 respectively demonstrating synergistic inhibition of the drug combinations. In tumor xenograft models combined treatment with NOS robustly augmented the anti-cancer actions of TMZ and CIS and showed no detectable toxicity. The combined treatments significantly enhanced the apoptosis the activated caspase-3 and PARP levels in U87MG cells in vitro and reduced Ki67 staining and increased the activated caspase-3 level in the shrinking xenografts in vivo. Conclusion: NOS synergistically potentiated the efficacy of FDA-approved anti-cancer drugs against human glioblastoma cells thereby allowing them to be used at lower doses and hence minimizing their toxic side effects.,,Keqiang ,,10.1038/aps.2013.40,,Is this publication relevent to this project?,
2e4d3aaa-66f4-4e4a-8c3a-5f41690dda16,Study on therapeutic action and mechanism of TMZ Combined with RITA against glioblastoma,2019,Background/Aims: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a malignant and aggressive central nervous system (CNS) tumor with high mortality and low survival rate. Effective treatment of GMB is a challenge worldwide. Temozolomide (TMZ) is a drug used to treat GBM while the survival period of GBM patients with positive treatment remains less than 15 months. Reactivating p53 and Inducing Tumor Apoptosis (RITA) is a novel potential anti-cancer small molecular drug. Thus it is essential to discover novel targets or develop effective drugs combination strategy to treat GBM. Method(s): The U87 cells and U251 cells (p53 mutated) were treated with DMSO and 1 510 20 muM RITA TMZ RITA+TMA or PFT-alpha. The cell proliferation was measured using the MTS cell proliferation assay. The cell apoptosis was analyzed by Annexin V-FITC/PI Apoptosis Detection Kit. The key protein expression level was evaluated by WB. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation methods were applied to simulate the interaction between RITA and ASK1. Result(s): Herein we found that combination RITA and TMZ effectively inhibited the proliferation of U87 cells and promoted the apoptosis of U87 cells. Then the mechanism of RITA and TMZ treating GBM were further studied by detecting the expression of the proteins associating with p53 pathway such as ASK1 Bax and so on. RITA bound to the amino acids residues in the activation domain of the ASK1 then induced the conformation change of ASK1 receptor activated ASK1 and caused a series of signal transduction further resulted in the physiological effects. Conclusion(s): Taken together the RITA suppressed the cell proliferation in glioblastoma via targeting ASK1.Copyright © 2018 The Author(s). Published by S.

31137ac7-f692-45d2-abad-3dbc1fd11e3f,Inhibition of JNK Potentiates Temozolomide-induced Cytotoxicity in U87MG Glioblastoma Cells via Suppression of Akt Phosphorylation,2014,Glioblastoma (formally glioblastoma multiforme GBM) represents both the most common and most malignant variant among numerous of primary brain tumors. Temozolomide (TMZ) has been used for the treatment of glioblastoma. However less than 1/3 of glioblastomas respond to TMZ-based therapies. Therefore strategies to enhance the effect of TMZ are needed for more effective targeted therapeutics. Stress-activated protein kinases (SAPKs) JNK and p38 MAPK have been known to have apoptotic or anti-apoptotic effects depending on cell type and condition. On the other hand Akt is a key regulator of cellular survival and has direct effects on the apoptosis machinery. In addition it was discovered that Akt activation is primed by the activity of JNK. We therefore examined whether inhibition of JNK or p38 potentiates TMZ-induced apoptosis in U87MG cells via inhibition of Akt activation. TMZ significantly induced Akt activation as well as JNK or p38 activation. Inhibition of JNK suppressed Akt activation and potentiated TMZ-induced cytotoxicity. The phosphorylation of GSK-3 beta and Bad the downstream mediators of Akt was also suppressed by the inhibition of JNK. The present data strongly suggest that there may be a crosstalk between JNK pathway and Akt pathway in glioblastoma and that further investigation based on the present data may provide a valuable approach for enhancing TMZ-induced cytotoxicity in glioblastoma.,,Sung-Soo ,,NA,,Is this publication relevent to this project?,
3243cd84-dc80-43a2-acf9-6131dc51bd27,Anti-tumor activities of luteolin and silibinin in glioblastoma cells: overexpression of miR-7-1-3p augmented luteolin and silibinin to inhibit autophagy and induce apoptosis in glioblastoma in vivo,2016,Glioblastoma is the deadliest brain tumor in humans. High systemic toxicity of conventional chemotherapies prompted the search for natural compounds for controlling glioblastoma. The natural flavonoids luteolin (LUT) and silibinin (SIL) have anti-tumor activities. LUT inhibits autophagy cell proliferation metastasis and angiogenesis and induces apoptosis; while SIL activates caspase-8 cascades to induce apoptosis. However synergistic anti-tumor effects of LUT and SIL in glioblastoma remain unknown. Overexpression of tumor suppressor microRNA (miR) could enhance the anti-tumor effects of LUT and SIL. Here we showed that 20 mu M LUT and 50 mu M SIL worked synergistically for inhibiting growth of two different human glioblastoma U87MG (wild-type p53) and T98G (mutant p53) cell lines and natural combination therapy was more effective than conventional chemotherapy (10 mu M BCNU or 100 mu M TMZ). Combination of LUT and SIL caused inhibition of growth of glioblastoma cells due to induction of significant amounts of apoptosis and complete inhibition of invasion and migration. Further combination of LUT and SIL inhibited rapamycin (RAPA)-induced autophagy a survival mechanism with suppression of PKC alpha and promotion of apoptosis through down regulation of iNOS and significant increase in expression of the tumor suppressor miR-7-1-3p in glioblastoma cells. Our in vivo studies confirmed that overexpression of miR-7-1-3p augmented anti-tumor activities of LUT and SIL in RAPA pre-treated both U87MG and T98G tumors. In conclusion our results clearly demonstrated that overexpression of miR-7-1-3p augmented the anti-tumor activities of LUT and SIL to inhibit autophagy and induce apoptosis for controlling growth of different human glioblastomas in vivo.,,K ,,10.1007/s10495-015-1198-x,,Is this publication relevent to this project?,
33a81c12-a825-4914-ab13-b1d59754ee5c,Combined effects of mesenchymal stem cells carrying cytosine deaminase gene with 5-fluorocytosine and temozolomide in orthotopic glioma model,2020,Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common and aggressive primary brain tumor and current standard therapy provides modest improvements in progression-free and overall survival of patients. Innate tumor resistance and presence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) require the development of multi-modal therapeutic regimens. Previously cytosine deaminase (CD)-expressing mesenchymal stem cells (MSC/CD) were found to exhibit anticancer activity with a wide therapeutic index by converting 5-fluorocytosine (5-FC) a nontoxic prodrug into 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) a potent anticancer drug. In this study we evaluated the efficacy of MSC/CD in a multi-modal combination regimen with temozolomide (TMZ). Cell viability test cell cycle and normalized isobologram analyses were performed. In vivo anticancer effects were tested in a mouse orthotopic glioma model. TMZ and MSC/CD with 5-FC synergistically interacted and suppressed U87 glioma cell line growth in vitro. Combined treatment with TMZ and 5-FU increased cell cycle arrest and DNA breakage.

374a3cac-e655-4e79-9257-8e5dfe55f639,β-Elemene inhibits proliferation through crosstalk between glia maturation factor β and extracellular signal‑regulated kinase 1/2 and impairs drug resistance to temozolomide in glioblastoma cells,2014,β-elemene a plant-derived drug extracted from Curcuma wenyujin has demonstrated marked antiproliferative effects on glioblastoma while toxicity remains low. However the underlying molecular mechanisms of the antitumor activity of β-elemene remain to be elucidated. Previously it was identified that the glia maturation factor β (GMFβ)/mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MAPK) 3/6/p38 pathway participates in the antiproliferative activity of β-elemene on glioblastoma. In the present study in order to illustrate the association of GMFβ and the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) pathway U87 and U251 cells were treated with β-elemene at various doses and for different durations and the expression of phosphorylated ERK1/2 (p-ERK1/2) ERK1/2 B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) Bcl2-associated X and survivin was examined by western blot analysis. Following treatment with β-elemene and the ERK1/2 inhibitor PD98059 U87 cell viability was evaluated using a Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay and the expression levels of Bcl-2 and survivin were examined by western blot analysis. GMFβ was then downregulated by RNA interference in β-elemene-treated U87 cells and the effect of this on the expression of ERK1/2 and p-ERK1/2 was determined by western blot analysis. Finally the chemosensitisation of U87 cells to temozolomide (TMZ) through β-elemene was examined using the CCK-8 assay. The results demonstrated that β-elemene inhibited the proliferation of U87 glioblastoma cells through the GMFβ‑dependent inactivation of the ERK1/2-Bcl-2/survivin pathway. Furthermore inhibition of ERK1/2 by PD98059 enhanced the antitumor effect of β-elemene and impaired the expression levels of Bcl-2 and survivin. β-elemene also increased the sensitivity of U87 glioblastoma cells to the chemotherapeutic TMZ which was synergistically enhanced by PD98059. In conclusion these results suggested that GMFβ-dependent inactivation of the ERK1/2-Bcl-2/survivin pathway mediated the antiproliferative effect of β-elemene on glioblastoma. Therefore β-elemene is a promising chemosensitizer or adjuvant therapeutic for TMZ against glioblastoma brain tumors.,,Guo-Biao ,,10.3892/mmr.2014.2273,,Is this publication relevent to this project?,

There are abundant molecular alterations along the p53 and MDM2 pathways in human glioma which play critical roles in drug resistance. The present study was designed to evaluate the in vitro and in vivo antitumor activity of a novel brain-penetrating small molecule MDM2 degrader termed SP-141. In a panel of nine human glioblastoma and medulloblastoma cell lines SP-141 as a single agent potently killed the brain tumor-derived cell lines with IC(50) values ranging from 35.8 to 688.8 nM. Treatment with SP-141 resulted in diminished MDM2 and increased p53 and p21(cip1) levels G2/M cell cycle arrest and marked apoptosis. In intracranial xenograft models of U87MG glioblastoma (wt p53) and DAOY medulloblastoma (mutant p53) expressing luciferase treatment with SP-141 caused a significant 4- to 9-fold decrease in tumor growth in the absence of discernible toxicity. Further combination treatment with a low dose of SP-141 (IC(20)) and temozolomide a standard anti-glioma drug led to synergistic cell killing (1.3- to 31-fold) in glioma cell lines suggesting a novel means for overcoming temozolomide resistance. Considering that SP-141 can be taken up by the brain without the need for any special delivery our results suggest that SP-141 should be further explored for the treatment of tumors of the central nervous system regardless of the p53 status of the tumor.,,Wei ,,10.3390/cells9071592,,Is this publication relevent to this project?,
3d5192a0-1eff-4f41-a7c5-bee063c8af06,Suppression of the Eag1 potassium channel sensitizes glioblastoma cells to injury caused by temozolomide,2016,Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most aggressive type of human primary brain tumor. The standard treatment protocol includes radiotherapy in combination with temozolomide (TMZ). Despite advances in GBM treatment the survival time of patients diagnosed with glioma is 14.5 months. Regarding tumor biology various types of cancer cell overexpress the ether a go-go 1 (Eag1) potassium channel. Therefore the present study examined the role of Eag1 in the cell damage caused by TMZ on the U87MG glioblastoma cell line. Eag1 was inhibited using a channel blocker (astemizole) or silenced by a short-hairpin RNA expression vector (pKv10.1-3). pKv10.1-3 (0.2 mug) improved the Eag1 silencing caused by 250 muM TMZ as determined by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunocytochemistry. Additionally inhibiting Eag1 with the vector or astemizole (5 muM) reduced glioblastoma cell viability and sensitized cells to TMZ. Cell viability decreased by 63% for pKv10.1-3 + TMZ compared with 34% for TMZ alone and by 77% for astemizole + TMZ compared with 46% for TMZ alone as determined by MTT assay. In addition both the vector and astemizole increased the apoptosis rate of glioblastoma cells triggered by TMZ as determined by an Annexin V apoptosis assay. Collectively the current data reveal that Eag1 has a role in the damage caused to glioblastoma by TMZ. Furthermore suppression of this channel can improve the action of TMZ on U87MG glioblastoma cells. Thus silencing Eag1 is a promising strategy to improve GBM treatment and merits additional studies in animal models of glioma.Copyright © 2016 Spandidos Publications.

The aim of this study was to purify identify and evaluate the mechanisms underlining anticancer activity of A. satureioides flavonoids in glioma cell lines (U87 U251 and C6) as well as their comparative toxicity in normal brain cells (primary astrocytes neurons and organotypic hippocampal cultures). The main flavonoids present in A. satureioides are luteolin quercetin 3-O-methyl-quercetin and achyrobichalcone the later a very unique metabolite present in this plant .Isolated flavonoids as well as A. satureioides extracts reduced proliferation and clonogenic survival and induced apoptosis of glioma cell lines. In addition A satureioides flavonoids potentiated the cytotoxic effect and apoptosis induction by the glioma chemotherapeutic temozolomide (TMZ). Importantly A. satureioides flavonoids were less cytotoxic to astrocytes neuron:astrocytes co-cultures and hippocampal cultures if compared to gliomas. Investigation of 10 cancer-related pathways showed a reduced activation of MYC and the Map kinases ERK and JNK by A. satureioides flavonoid-enriched extract an effect not observed when individual flavonoids were evaluated.

The development of new therapeutic strategies for the management of gliomas is therefore crucial. The present study is designed to analyze the therapeutic potentials of synthetic compound N-(2-hydroxyphenyl)acetamide (NA-2) in the treatment of GBM as a single agent or in combination with Temozolomide (TMZ) on glioblastoma cells. Method(s): MTT and TUNEL assays were used to detect the growth inhibitory effect and apoptotic activity of NA-2 alone and in combination with TMZ. Synergy was assessed using combination Index method. The expression of apoptosis related markers Bax Bcl-2 and caspase-3 were assessed by RT-PCR whereas the active caspase-3 protein expression was determined using imunocytochemistry. Result(s): Both NA-2 and TMZ inhibited the growth of U87 in a dose dependent manner. The combine administration of NA-2 (0.33 mM) and temozolomide (0.1 mM) significantly enhanced the cell growth inhibition and apoptosis. Furthermore RT-PCR and imunocytochemistry data revealed that cooperative apoptosis induction was associated with increased ratio of Bax to Bcl-2 and active Caspase-3 expression.

In the present study we investigated the roles of beta-elemene in the radiosensitivity and chemosensitivity of GBM cells. Human GBM cell lines U87-MG T98G U251 LN229 and rat C6 cells were treated with beta-elemene combined with radiation or TMZ. We used MTT and colony forming assays to evaluate the proliferation and survival of the cells and the comet assay to observe DNA damage. Expression of proteins was analyzed by immunoblotting. In the present study we found that beta-elemene inhibited the proliferation and survival of different GBM cell lines when combined with radiotherapy or TMZ via inhibition of DNA damage repair. Treatment of GBM cells with beta-elemene decreased the phosphorylation of ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) AKT and ERK following radiotherapy or chemotherapy. These results revealed that beta-elemene could significantly increase the radiosensitivity and chemosensitivity of GBM. beta-elemene may be used as a potential drug in combination with the radiotherapy and chemotherapy of GBM.,,Yuhui ,,10.3892/or.2015.4050,,Is this publication relevent to this project?,

Temozolomide (TMZ) has been used with irradiation (IR) to treat gliomas. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the cytotoxic and radiosensitizing effect of TMZ when combined with high-dose and high-dose rate of gamma irradiation in vitro. Method(s): Two 'U87MG' cell lines and skin fibroblast were cultured and assigned to five groups for 24 48 and 72 hours. The groups were namely TMZ group (2000 muM/L) IR group (5 Gy) TMZ plus IR group control group and control solvent group. MTT assay was applied to evaluate cell viability. Data were analyzed with SPSS 21.0 software using one-way ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis test. P<0.05 were considered statistically significant. Result(s): The slope of growth curve U87MG cells in semi-logarithmic scale was equal to 27.36+/-0.89 hours. The viability of cells was determined for different TMZ and IR treatment groups. In terms of cell viability there were no significant differences between the control and control solvent groups (P=0.35) and between treated group by IR (5 Gy) alone and TMZ (2000 micro M/ml) alone (P=0.15). Data obtained for the cell viability of combined TMZ plus IR in both cell lines compared to TMZ or IR treated group alone showed a significant difference (P=0.002). Conclusion(s): The evaluation of cells viability showed that TMZ in combination with IR on glioma cells led to a significant radiosensitivity compared to IR alone.Copyright © 2017 Shiraz University of Medical Sciences.

45399c50-6151-4f40-be63-77f2c3ba2ecc,Downregulation of miR-155 inhibits proliferation and enhances chemosensitivity to Temozolomide in glioma cells,2017,Background and aims: MicroRNA-155 (miR-155) is highly expressed in many malignant tumors including glioma. Overexpression of miR-155 has a poor prognosis in patients with gliomas. Recent study has revealed that miR-155-silencing therapies could be a valuable approach to be associated with anticancer drugs and chemotherapy treatments. This study aimed to investigate its functional role of miR-155 on cell proliferation and chemosensitivity to Temozolomide (TMZ) as well as its possible molecular mechanisms. Methods: Effects of miR-155 overexpression (miR-155) or miR-155 silencing (anti-miR-155) on proliferation apoptosis and chemosensitivity to TMZ in U87 or U251 human glioma cell line was detected. Bim cDNA and Bim siRNA transfection was used to assess the relation between miR-155 and Bim. Different protein and mRNA expression was detected by western blotting assay and quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays. Results: miR-155 transfection induces cell survival tumorigenicity and chemoresistance to TMZ whereas anti-miR-155 transfection renders cells to apoptosis and enhances chemosensitivity. Further we identified Bim as a target of miR-155. Sustained miR-155 resulted in repression of Bim protein and mRNA levels and knockdown of miR-155 increases Bim. Introduction of Bim cDNA abrogates miR-155-induced cell survival and chemoresistance. However introduction of Bim siRNA abrogates anti-miR-155-induced cell apoptosis and chemosensitivity. Conclusions: Our study reveals a molecular link between miR-155 and Bim and presents evidence that miR-155 is a critical therapeutic target in glioma.,,Weicheng ,,NA,,Is this publication relevent to this project?,
46ebea93-7a32-4a77-aabc-51ae3a316ca1,Next Generation Sequencing-Based Transcriptome Predicts Bevacizumab Efficacy in Combination with Temozolomide in Glioblastoma,2019,Glioblastoma (GBM) the most common and malignant brain tumor is classified according to its isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation status in the 2016 World Health Organization (WHO) brain tumor classification scheme. The standard treatment for GBM is maximal resection radiotherapy and Temozolomide (TMZ). Recently Bevacizumab (Bev) has been added to basic therapy for newly diagnosed GBM and monotherapy for recurrent GBM. However the effect of IDH1 mutation on the combination of Bev and TMZ is unknown. In this study we performed transcriptomic analysis by RNA sequencing with next generation sequencing (NGS) a newly developed powerful method that enables the quantification of the expression level of genome-wide genes. Extracellular matrix and immune cell migration genes were mainly upregulated whereas cell cycle genes were downregulated in IDH1-mutant U87 cells but not in IDH1-wildtype U87 cells after adding Bev to TMZ. In vitro and in vivo studies were conducted for further investigations to verify these results and the addition of Bev to TMZ showed a significant antitumor effect only in the IDH1-mutant GBM xenograft model. Further studies of gene expression profiling in IDH1 mutation gliomas using NGS will provide more genetic information and will lead to new treatments for this refractory disease.,,Atsushi ,,10.3390/molecules24173046,,Is this publication relevent to this project?,

The sensitivity of Temozolomide-Succinic acid and Temozolomide-Oxalic acid cocrystals (TMZ-SA and TMZ-OA) in inhibiting the proliferation and growth of human glioblastoma malignant cell lines U373 U87 and LN18 is comparable to the reference drug. Both TMZ-SA and TMZ-OA cocrystals are stable to long term storage (white color powder) whereas TMZ becomes tan brown within 2 months (indicative of degradation).

499a3e31-87d2-48fa-84bd-abef9c57df96,Growth Inhibitory Effects of Dipotassium Glycyrrhizinate in Glioblastoma Cell Lines by Targeting MicroRNAs Through the NF-kappa B Signaling Pathway,2019,It has been shown that nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-kappa B) is constitutively activated in glioblastoma (GBM) suggesting that the pathway could be a therapeutic target. Glycyrrhetic acid (GA) a compound isolated from licorice (Glycyrrhiza glabra) has bee n shown to decrease cell viability and increases apoptosis in human cancer cell lines by NF-kappa B signaling pathway suppression. Dipotassium glycyrrhizinate (DPG) a dipotassium salt of GA has anti-inflammatory properties without toxicity. The current study examined the effectiveness of DPG as an anti-tumor in U87MG and T98G GBM cell lines. Additionally we assessed DPG as a candidate for combinational therapy in GBM with temozolomide (TMZ). Our results demonstrated that the viability of U87MG and T98G cells significantly decreased in a time- and dose-dependent manner after DPG treatment and the apoptotic ratio of DPG-treated groups was significantly higher than that of control groups. In addition DPG in combination with TMZ revealed synergistic effects. Furthermore the expression of NF-kappa B-luciferasereporter in transfected GBM cell lines was remarkably reduced after DPG exposure by up-regulating miR16 and miR146a which down-regulate its target genes IRAK2 and TRAF6. A reduced neuro-sphere formation was also observed after DPG in both GBM cells. In conclusion DPG presented anti-tumoral effect on GBM cell lines through a decrease on proliferation and an increase on apoptosis. In addition our data also suggest that DPG anti-tumoral effect is related to NF-kappa B suppression where IRAK2- and TRAF6-mediating miR16 and miF?146a respectively might be a potential therapeutic target of DPG.,,Marques ,,10.3389/fncel.2019.00216,,Is this publication relevent to this project?,

The anti-malarial artesunate was previously shown to exert a profound cytotoxic effect on various tumor cell lines including those derived from glioblastoma. In the current study we sought to examine the antiproliferative effect of a combination of temozolomide and artesunate on two different established human glioblastoma cell lines. The IC50 and IC25 were determined for temozolomide and artesunate in U87MG and A172 glioblastoma cell lines after 144 h of continuous drug exposure. The antiproliferative effect of combining both agents at IC50 /IC50 and IC25 /IC25 was determined by a cell viability assay. Moreover necrosis and apoptosis were analyzed by annexin V/PI staining and flow cytometric analysis. In addition cytostatic effects were examined by carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester staining and subsequent flow cytometry. In both glioblastoma cell lines artesunate was found to enhance the antiproliferative effect exerted by temozolomide. Moreover artesunate acted in concert with temozolomide in terms of cytostatic and necrotizing effects. These observations suggest that a combination of artesunate and temozolomide might result in increased cytotoxicity in glioblastoma.,,Marc-Eric ,,10.2174/18715206113136660340,,Is this publication relevent to this project?,

This study aimed to investigate the possible mechanism of mutant TP53 inducing temozolomide resistance in glioblastoma cells. Three established human glioma cell lines T98G U87 and U138 were chemoresistant cells. The mRNA of cells was sequenced to confirm the status of TP53. Synthetic small interfering RNA (siRNA) was used to knock down TP53 in cells. TP53 mRNA was detected [']silenced['] by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in five consecutive days. Viable cell survival was measured when these cells were exposed to temozolomide or semustine in step-up concentrations. The expression of O-6-methylguanine DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT) at mRNA level was also determined. T98G U87 and U138 cells were resistant to temozolomide. T98G and U138 cells expressed mutant-type TP53 with positive MGMT while U87 cell expressed wild-type TP53 with negative MGMT. TP53-siRNA knocked down TP53 effectively (P = 0.021) in five consecutive days. Knockdown of mutant TP53 in T98G and U138 cells led to a fivefold increase in chemosensitivity to temozolomide but not semustine. Knockdown of wild TP53 in U87 cell did not affect the chemoresistance. In addition mutant TP53 knockdown induced a dramatic decrease of MGMT expression (P = 0.0000034). TP53 mutation decreases the chemosensitivity of malignant gliomas to temozolomide. This [']gain of function['] in drug resistance may be obtained by increasing MGMT expression.,,Qing ,,10.1007/s10072-012-1257-9,,Is this publication relevent to this project?,

Random and block copolymers were synthesized by reversible addition fragmentation chain-transfer (RAFT) polymerization using a TMZ-containing methacrylate monomer. The solution properties of the polyMPC-TMZ copolymers were investigated by dynamic light scattering and transmission electron microscopy revealing well-defined nanostructures from the block copolymers. Conjugation of TMZ to polyMPC enhanced drug stability with decomposition half-life values ranging from 2- to 19-times longer than that of free TMZ. The cytotoxicity of polyMPC TMZ was evaluated in both chemosensitive (U87MG) and chemoresistant (T98G) glioblastoma cell lines. Furthermore the polyMPC TMZ platform was expanded considerably by the preparation of redox-sensitive polyMPC-TMZ copolymers utilizing disulfides as the polymer-to-drug linker.,,Todd ,,10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00766,,Is this publication relevent to this project?,

A major underlying cause is high intra- and extracellular levels of a virus-encoded peptide termed viral protein R (Vpr). As Vpr efficiently crosses the blood-brain barrier and accumulates in astrocytes we examined whether it may be utilized as a drug in the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) Methods: Four glioblastoma-derived cell lines with and without lentivirus-mediated Methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) overexpression (U251 U87 U251-MGMT U87-MGMT) were exposed to Vpr temozolomide (TMZ) conventional photon irradiation (2-6 Gy) or to combinations. Caspase assays were employed to detect apoptosis. Colony formation assays were used to analyse clonogenic survival. Dose escalation was performed using n = 12 NOD/SCID/gammac-/- (NSG) mice in a classical 3+3 manner. This strain was also used as an orthotopic implant model of glioma using luciferase-expressing U87 cells (n = 18). Continuous Vpr administration was achieved using osmotic pumps irradiation (3x5 Gy) was performed using a small-animal irradiation device and intracerebral tumor growth was monitored using repetitive contrast-enhanced micro CT scans Results: Vpr showed high rates of acute toxicities with a LD50 of 4.0+/-1.1 muM for U251 and a LD50 of 15.7+/-7.5 muM for U87 cells. Caspase assays revealed Vpr-induced apoptosis in U251 but not in U87 cells. Vpr also efficiently inhibited clonogenic survival both in U251 and U87 cells and showed additive effects with irradiation. In contrast to TMZ Vpr acted independently of the MGMT expression status. Dose escalation in mice (n = 12) was feasible and resulted in no evident renal or liver toxicity. Similar to irradiation with 3 x 5 Gy (n = 8) Vpr treatment of orthotopically implanted NSG mice (n = 5) delayed tumor growth and significantly (p = 0.041; log-rank test) prolonged overall survival compared to untreated animals (n = 5) Conclusion(s): The HIV-encoded peptide Vpr exhibits all properties of an effective chemotherapeutic drug and may be a useful agent in the treatment of GBM.,,F ,,10.1158/1538-7445.AM2015-4458,,Is this publication relevent to this project?,
5b37c0d7-1db2-479b-813f-90f94b38cf87,Gene expression profiling predicts response to temozolomide in malignant gliomas,2010,Malignant gliomas are highly lethal neoplasms that cannot be cured with currently available therapies. Temozolomide (TMZ) is a recently introduced alkylating agent that has yielded significant benefits and become a key agent in the treatment of high-grade gliomas. However its survival benefit remains unsatisfactory. Understanding the molecular basis of TMZ sensitivity/resistance is necessary for improving the treatment outcome by devising strategies that are able to circumvent primary drug resistance. We therefore combined the in vitro TMZ response with microarray gene expression data to identify genes that could potentially be used to predict the response of malignant gliomas to TMZ therapy. We first obtained the individual IC50 values for TMZ in seven malignant glioma cell lines (A-172 AM-38 T98G U-87MG U-138MG U-251MG and YH-13) and then identified the genes whose expression correlated most highly with TMZ sensitivity employing a cDNA microarray. We present here a list of the most highly up-regulated and down-regulated genes which may be involved in conferring TMZ sensitivity/resistance in malignant gliomas although most of the genes have not been implicated as a causal factor in the TMZ response except MGMT. We also demonstrated and confirmed the MGMT methylation status quantitative MGMT mRNA levels and MGMT protein expression levels in TMZ resistant glioma cells in vitro. Our results are thus consistent with previous studies and suggest that a dominant mechanism conferring sensitivity/resistance to TMZ exists in malignant glioma cells. Although the present study dose have several limitations our reported candidate genes could represent not only potential molecular markers for TMZ sensitivity/resistance but also chemotherapy targets. Furthermore the present study could provide a foundation for alternative therapeutic strategies including novel combination treatments that incorporate additional reagents directed at overcoming resistance to TMZ.,,Kouhei ,,10.3892/ijo_00000621,,Is this publication relevent to this project?,

In this study we investigated whether I-BET151 a specific BET inhibitor could sensitize GBM cells to TMZ. Our findings showed that the action of I-BET151 could augment the effect of TMZ on cancer cells U251 and U87 cells. In U251 cells administration of I-BET151 increased the TMZ-induced apoptosis GBM cells. I-BET151 remarkably enhanced the activities of caspase-3. In addition I-BET151 promoted TMZ-induced migration and invasion in GBM cells. Moreover I-BET151 increased the amount of reactive oxygen species as well as superoxide anions with a decrease of activity of SOD and the anti-oxidative properties of GBM cells. I-BET151 also induced increased PUMA expression which is required for the functions of I-BET151 and regulates the synergistic cytotoxic effects of i-BET151 and TMZ in GBM cells. I-BET151 with TMZ also showed synergistic cytotoxic effects in vivo. These point out to an approach to tackle GBM using TMZ along with BET inhibitors.,,Xin ,,10.1038/s41417-018-0068-4,,Is this publication relevent to this project?,
64f4064d-1690-4af7-be0a-4ce029049460,GADD45A plays a protective role against temozolomide treatment in glioblastoma cells,2017,Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is one of the most aggressive cancers. Despite recent advances in multimodal therapies high-grade glioma remains fatal. Temozolomide (TMZ) is an alkylating agent used worldwide for the clinical treatment of GBM; however the innate and acquired resistance of GBM limits its application. Here we found that TMZ inhibited the proliferation and induced the G2/M arrest of GBM cells. Therefore we performed microarrays to identify the cell cycle- and apoptosis-related genes affected by TMZ. Notably GADD45A was found to be up-regulated by TMZ in both cell cycle and apoptosis arrays. Furthermore GADD45A knockdown (GADD45A(kd)) enhanced the cell growth arrest and cell death induced by TMZ even in natural (T98) and adapted (TR-U373) TMZ-resistant cells. Interestingly GADD45A(kd) decreased the expression of O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) in TMZ-resistant cells (T98 and TR-U373). In MGMT-deficient/TMZ-sensitive cells (U87 and U373) GADD45A(kd) decreased TMZ-induced TP53 expression. Thus in this study we investigated the genes influenced by TMZ that were important in GBM therapy and revealed that GADD45A plays a protective role against TMZ treatment which may through TP53-dependent and MGMT-dependent pathway in TMZ-sensitive and TMZ-resistant GBM respectively. This protective role of GADD45A against TMZ treatment may provide a new therapeutic strategy for GBM treatment.,,Jyh-Wei ,,10.1038/s41598-017-06851-3,,Is this publication relevent to this project?,

We observed a strong decrease in cell proliferation along with a concomitant increase in cell death as a function of the radiation dose. As expected high-LET radiation was more effective and induced more sustained damage to DNA than low-LET radiation. While RAD001 in association with TMZ induced autophagic cell death additional combination with either type of radiation did not further increase its occurrence. On the contrary apoptosis remained at a low level in all experimental groups.,,Pierre ,,10.3892/or.2014.3590,,Is this publication relevent to this project?,

With the aim to better understand the resistance/susceptibility processes associated to temozolomide (TMZ) treatment the current study was performed in three human malignant glioma cell lines by focusing on several levels: (a) apoptotic index and senescence (b) DNA damage and (c) interaction of HSPB1 with players of the DNA damage response. Three human glioma cell lines Gli36 U87 and DBTRG were treated with TMZ evaluating cell viability and survival apoptosis senescence and comets (comet assay). The expression of HSPA (HSPA1A and HSPA8) HSPB1 O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) MLH1 and MSH2 was determined by immunocytochemistry immunofluorescence and Western blot. Immunoprecipitation was used to analyze protein interaction. The cell lines exhibited differences in viability apoptosis and senescence after TMZ administration. We then focused on Gli36 cells (relatively unstudied) which showed very low recovery capacity following TMZ treatment and this was related to high DNA damage levels,,Daniel ,,10.1007/s12192-014-0537-0,,Is this publication relevent to this project?,
669f4d04-f0ad-477f-b15b-ca8ca4d0106b,High-throughput screening uncovers miRNAs enhancing glioblastoma cell susceptibility to tyrosine kinase inhibitors,2017,Glioblastoma (GBM) is a deadly and therapy resistant malignant brain tumour characterized by an aggressive and diffuse growth pattern which prevents complete surgical resection. Despite advances in the identification of genomic and molecular alterations that fuel the tumour average patient survival post-diagnosis remains very low (~14.6-months). In addition to being highly heterogeneous GBM tumour cells exhibit high adaptive capacity to targeted molecular therapies owing to an established network of signalling cascades with functional redundancy which provides them with robust compensatory survival mechanisms. Here we investigated whether a multimodal strategy combining multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors (MTKIs) and microRNA (miRNA) modulation could overcome the signalling pathway redundancy in GBM and hence promote tumour cell death. By performing a high-throughput screening we identified a myriad of miRNAs including those belonging to the miR-302-3p/372-3p/373-3p/520-3p family which coordinately act with the MTKI sunitinib to decrease GBM cell viability. Two members of this family hsa-miRNA-302a-3p and hsa-miRNA-520 b were found to modulate the expression of receptor tyrosine kinase mediators (including AKT1 PIK3CA and SOS1) in U87 and DBTRG human GBM cells. Importantly administration of mimics of these miRNAs with sunitinib or axitinib resulted in decreased tumour cell proliferation and enhanced cell death whereas no significant effect was observed when coupling miRNA modulation with temozolomide the first-line drug for GBM therapy. Overall our results provide evidence that combining the 'horizontal' inhibition of signalling pathways promoted by MTKIs with the 'vertical' inhibition of the downstreamsignalling cascade promoted by hsa-miR-302a-3p and hsamiR- 520 b constitutes a promising approach towards GBM treatment.Copyright © The Author 2017.

6a9181c7-3dcb-4cde-bfc3-39e14ac2690a,Zinc enhances TMZ cytotoxicity in glioblastoma multiforme model system,2013,Temozolomide (TMZ) is an alkylating agent that has become a mainstay of the treatment of malignant brain cancer glioblastoma multiforme. Unfortunately only a limited number of patients benefit from it. We hypothesized that p53 inactivation has a role in TMZ response and zinc (Zn) can restore this p53 critical function. Accordingly we tested if addition of zinc to TMZ enhances its cytotoxicity in a model system using 3 brain cancer cell lines. Overexpressed and active O6-methylguanine-DNA methyl transferase (MGMT) enzyme imparts resistance to the cytotoxic effects of TMZ. Therefore we used 3 glioblastoma cell lines exhibiting different status of both MGMT and p53: U87 (MGMT-/ p53 wt) U251 (MGMT-/ p53 mutant) and T98G (MGMT + / p53 mutant). Cytotoxicity was determined by colony and viability assays after 7 days of treatment. As expected TMZ + /-Zn had no effect on T98G since it has an active MGMT. Conversely in U251 cells cellular viability was significantly reduced when cells were treated with TMZ and zinc (72% cell death) compared to 44% cell death during TMZ treatment alone. Comparable results were obtained with U87 cells. Interestingly immunofluorescence studies detected p53 to be in its inactive conformation in U87 cells shifting to an active form after TMZ + Zn treatment. Detection of cell proliferation by plate colony formation assay revealed a 4 fold decrease between TMZ treatment alone and TMZ + ZnforU87 cells and 2.5 fold forU251 cells. Insummary zinc enhances the cytotoxicity of TMZ in the GBM U251 and U87 cell lines. Thus zinc may be a promising addition to TMZ therapy. Zinc being an essential mineral can be easily added to clinical protocols.,,M ,,10.1093/neuonc/not176,,Is this publication relevent to this project?,

Temozolomide (TMZ) has been used as a first-line drug for the treatment of GBM for over a decade but its treatment benefits are limited by acquired resistance. Polysaccharides from Cibotium barometz (CBPs) are polysaccharides purified from the root of Cibotium barometz ( L)J. Sin. possessing sensitizing activity. The purpose of this study was to investigate the anti-cancer effect of CBP from different processing methods on U87 cells using a 'H NMR-based metabolic approach complemented with qRT-PCR and flow cytometry to identify potential markers and discover the targets to explore the underlying mechanism. Cibotium barometz is usually processed under sand heating in clinical applications. Polysaccharides from both the processed (PCBP) and raw (RCBP) C barometz were prepared and the effect on enhancing the sensitivity to TMZ was investigated in vitro. CBP can significantly increase the toxicity ofTMZ to the U87 cell line promote apoptosis enhance cell cycle changes and arrest cells in S phase and RCBP demonstrated better activity. Multivariate statistical analyses such as principal component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal projection to latent structure with discriminant analysis (OPTS-DA) were used to identify metabolic biomarkers and 12 metabolites in the cell extract samples were clearly identified as altered after RCBP exposure. NMR-based cell metabolomics provided a holistic method for the identification of CBP's apoptosis-enhancing mechanisms and the exploration of its potential applications in preclinical and clinical studies.

As Vpr efficiently crosses the blood-brain barrier and accumulates in astrocytes we examined its efficacy as a drug for treatment of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM).

Vpr showed high rates of acute toxicities with median effective doses of 4.0+/-1.1 muM and 15.7+/-7.5 muM for U251 and U87 cells respectively. Caspase assays revealed Vpr-induced apoptosis in U251 but not in U87 cells. Vpr also efficiently inhibited clonogenic survival in both U251 and U87 cells and acted additively with irradiation. In contrast to TMZ Vpr acted independently of MGMT expression. Dose escalation in mice (n=12) was feasible and resulted in no evident renal or liver toxicity. Both irradiation with 3x5 Gy (n=8) and treatment with Vpr (n=5) delayed intracerebral tumor growth and prolonged overall survival compared to untreated animals (n=5; p3x5 Gy < 0.001 and pVpr=0.04; log-rank test). Our data show that the HIV-encoded peptide Vpr exhibits all properties of an effective chemotherapeutic drug and may be a useful agent in the treatment of GBM.,,F ,,10.18632/oncotarget.9787,,Is this publication relevent to this project?,
6fd332b0-7035-4d6d-91ae-f6e126a394e8,Mechanisms operative in the antitumor activity of temozolomide in glioblastoma multiforme,2007,Purpose: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most frequent and incurable brain tumor in adults. Although temozolomide (TMZ) does not cure GBM it has demonstrated anti-GBM activity and has improved survival (8-14 months) and quality of life. We studied the mechanisms by which TMZ affects 2 human GBM cell lines; U251-MG and U87-MG aiming to unravel the drug-activated cascades to enable the development of combination therapies that will improve the efficacy of TMZ. Materials and Methods: The 3-(45-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-25-diphenyltetrazolium assay was used to assess cell viability. Modulation of gene expression by TMZ therapy was assayed by gene profiling and verified by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Protein levels influenced by the treatment were studied by Western blots and immunocytochemistry. Results: Increasing concentrations of TMZ decreased cell viability in a concentration-dependent manner. The expression of 1886 genes was altered >2-fold after TMZ treatment. We focused on the 81 genes similarly altered by TMZ treatment in both cell lines to neutralize tissue-specific characteristics. Fourteen target genes of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1) were found to be up-regulated after TMZ treatment including vascular endothelial growth factor (UEGF). HIF-1 alpha expression was constant at the mRNA level; however its post-treatment protein levels increased compared with those of untreated control cells. Discussion: The genetic analyses suggest that treatment with TMZ activates stress mechanisms in GBM cells that include the angiogenesis-inducing proteins HIF-1 alpha and VEGF. We propose that treatment with TMZ be supplemented with either an antibody to VEGF or down-regulators of HIF-1 alpha to improve clinical results of TMZ in the treatment of GBM.,,Amos ,,10.1097/PPO.0b013e318157053f,,Is this publication relevent to this project?,

Bufothionine is one of the major active ingredients of Cinobufacini. Although the antitumor activities of bufothionine have been reported the underlying mechanism remains unclear. The present study showed that bufothionine exhibited antigrowth activities in GBM cell lines U87 and U373. Further investigation showed that bufothionine triggered endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress to promote apoptosis in U87 and U373 cells. Moreover our results showed that bufothionine exhibited synergistic activities with Temozolomide (TMZ) to suppress the growth of U87 and U373 cells. The findings in the present study provide basis for further investigation of the therapeutic potential of bufothionine in GBM. Anat Rec 2019.

746a78ac-7f95-4a0b-aa64-9a0ffaecff07,Mechanisms and antitumor activity of a binary EGFR/DNA-targeting strategy overcomes resistance of glioblastoma stem cells to temozolomide,2019,Purpose: Glioblastoma (GBM) is a fatal primary malignant brain tumor. GBM stem cells (GSC) contribute to resistance to the DNA-damaging chemotherapy temozolomide. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) displays genomic alterations enabling DNA repair mechanisms in half of GBMs. We aimed to investigate EGFR/DNA combi-targeting in GBM. Experimental Design: ZR2002 is a [']combi-molecule['] designed to inflict DNA damage through its chlorethyl moiety and induce irreversible EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibition. We assessed its in vitro efficacy in temozolomide-resistant patient-derived GSCs mesenchymal temozolomide-sensitive and resistant in vivo-derived GSC sublines and U87/EGFR isogenic cell lines stably expressing EGFR/wild-type or variant III (EGFRvIII). We evaluated its antitumor activity in mice harboring orthotopic EGFRvIII or mesenchymal TMZ-resistant GSC tumors. Result(s): ZR2002 induced submicromolar antiproliferative effects and inhibited neurosphere formation of all GSCs with marginal effects on normal human astrocytes. ZR2002 inhibited EGF-induced autophosphorylation of EGFR downstream Erk1/2 phosphorylation increased DNA strand breaks and induced activation of wild-type p53; the latter was required for its cytotoxicity through p53-dependent mechanism. ZR2002 induced similar effects on U87/EGFR cell lines and its oral administration significantly increased survival in an orthotopic EGFRvIII mouse model. ZR2002 improved survival of mice harboring intracranial mesenchymal temozolomide-resistant GSC line decreased EGFR Erk1/2 and AKT phosphorylation and was detected in tumor brain tissue by MALDI imaging mass spectrometry. Conclusion(s): These findings provide the molecular basis of binary EGFR/DNA targeting and uncover the oral bioavailability blood-brain barrier permeability and antitumor activity of ZR2002 supporting potential evaluation of this first-in-class drug in recurrent GBM.Copyright ©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.,,S ,,10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-19-0955,,Is this publication relevent to this project?,
749a6f17-dd3a-4c97-9fbb-aca5567828a1,ATM inhibitor KU-55933 increases the TMZ responsiveness of only inherently TMZ sensitive GBM cells,2012,Ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase is critical in sensing and repairing DNA double-stranded breaks (DSBs) such as those induced by temozolomide (TMZ). ATM deficiency increases TMZ sensitivity which suggests that ATM inhibitors may be effective TMZ sensitizing agents. In this study the TMZ sensitizing effects of 2 ATM specific inhibitors were studied in established and xenograft-derived glioblastoma (GBM) lines that are inherently sensitive to TMZ and derivative TMZ-resistant lines. In parental U251 and U87 glioma lines the addition of KU-55933 to TMZ significantly increased cell killing compared to TMZ alone [U251 survival: 0.004 +/- 0.0015 vs. 0.08 +/- 0.01 (p < 0.001) respectively and U87 survival: 0.02 +/- 0.005 vs. 0.04 +/- 0.002 (p < 0.001) respectively] and also elevated the fraction of cells arrested in G2/M [U251 G2/M fraction: 61.8 +/- 1.1 % vs. 35 +/- 0.8 % (p < 0.001) respectively and U87 G2/M fraction 25 +/- 0.2 % vs.18.6 +/- 0.4 % (p < 0.001) respectively]. In contrast KU-55933 did not sensitize the resistant lines to TMZ and neither TMZ alone or combined with KU-55933 induced a G2/M arrest. While KU-55933 did not enhance TMZ induced Chk1/Chk2 activation it increased TMZ-induced residual gamma-H2AX foci in the parental cells but not in the TMZ resistant cells. Similar sensitization was observed with either KU-55933 or CP-466722 combined with TMZ in GBM12 xenograft line but not in GBM12TMZ which is resistant to TMZ due to MGMT overexpression. These findings are consistent with a model where ATM inhibition suppresses the repair of TMZ-induced DSBs in inherently TMZ-sensitive tumor lines which suggests an ATM inhibitor potentially could be deployed with an improvement in the therapeutic window when combined with TMZ.,,N ,,10.1007/s11060-012-0979-0,,Is this publication relevent to this project?,
75f5e9e5-f8eb-4ee0-ab34-f1ef5a73bbe8,Synergistic inhibition of human glioma cell line by temozolomide and PAMAM-mediated miR-21i,2013,Temozolomide (TMZ) is a promising chemotherapeutic agent for treating glioblastomas. However resistance develops quickly and with a high frequency. Efforts to overcome chemoresistance are therefore critically needed. In present study a poly(amidoamine; PAMAM) dendrimer was used as a vector to deliver microRNA-21 inhibitor (miR-21i) into U87 cells and the chemosensitivity of the combination effect of miR-21i and TMZ for glioma therapy was investigated. Flow cytometry analysis showed the uptake efficiency of microRNA-21 inhibitor after complexation with PAMAM. Real-time PCR and in situ hybridization indicated that compared with TMZ or miR-21i treated cells cells simultaneously treated with miR-21i and TMZ showed a remarkable decrease in the microRNA-21 (miR-21) level. The transfection of miR-21i enhanced the chemosensitivity by significantly decreasing the IC50 value of TMZ to glioma cells. Knockdown of miR-21 promoted the cells' apoptosis and at the same time inhibited cell invasion. In conclusion the combination treatment of glioma cells with TMZ and miR-21i could yield a synergistic effect in inhibition of human glioma cell line. (C) 2012 Wiley Periodicals Inc. J. Appl. Polym.

774834a4-675c-470a-9d56-6b7c089abf85,Radiobiological evaluation and correlation with the local effect model (LEM) of carbon ion radiation therapy and temozolomide in glioblastoma cell lines,2009,PURPOSE: To investigate the cytotoxic effect of high linear-energy transfer (LET) carbon irradiation on glioblastoma cells lines in combination with temozolomide (TMZ). METHODS AND MATERIALS: The cell lines U87-MG expressing wild-type p53 and LN229 expressing both mutant and wild-type p53 were irradiated with monoenergetic carbon ion beams (LET 172 keV/microm) or an extended Bragg peak (LET 103 keV/microm) after treatment with 10 microM or 20 microM TMZ. Cytotoxicity was measured by a clonogenic survival assay and cell growth as well as cell cycle progression were examined. RESULTS: The p53 mutant was more sensitive to X-ray irradiation than the p53 wild type cell line which was also expressed in a shorter G2 block. High LET carbon ions show an increased biological effectiveness in both cell lines which is consistent with the predictive calculations by the Local Effect Model (LEM) introduced by Scholz et al. The cell line LN229 was more sensitive to TMZ treatment than the U87MG cell line expressing wild-type p53 only. The combination of TMZ and irradiation showed an additive effect in both cell lines. CONCLUSION: High LET carbon ion irradiation is significantly more effective for glioblastoma cell lines compared to photon irradiation. An additional treatment with TMZ may offer a great chance especially for several tumor types.,,K ,,10.1080/09553000802641151,,Is this publication relevent to this project?,

The aim of this study was to investigate whether quercetin could sensitize human glioblastoma cells to temozolomide (TMZ) in vitro. METHODS: Both U251 and U87 human glioblastoma cells were treated with quercetin and/or TMZ for 48 h. Cell viability was detected using the MTT assay. Cell apoptosis was analyzed with caspase-3 activity kits and flow cytometry. Hsp27 expression and phosphorylation were examined using Western blot analysis. RNA interference using Hsp27 siRNA oligos was performed to knock down the gene expression of Hsp27. RESULTS: TMZ (200 or 400 μmol/L) alone effectively inhibited the viability of U251 and U87 cells. When combined with quercetin (30 μmol/L) TMZ (100 μmol/L) significantly inhibited the cell viability and the inhibition of TMZ (200 and 400 μmol/L) was enhanced. TMZ or quercetin anole did not affect caspase-3 activity and cell apoptosis while TMZ combined with quercetin significantly increased caspase-3 activity and induced cell apoptosis. TMZ anole significantly increased Hsp27 phosphorylation in U251 and U87 cells while quercetin or Hsp27 siRNA oligos combined with TMZ attenuated TMZ-induced Hsp27 phosphorylation and significantly inhibited Hsp27 expression. CONCLUSION: Combined treatment with TMZ and quercetin efficiently suppressed human glioblastoma cell survival in vitro.,,Qing ,,10.1038/aps.2014.22,,Is this publication relevent to this project?,
7b395094-08b8-4826-92e6-5e2c1ab16813,Berberine induces senescence of human glioblastoma cells by downregulating the EGFR-MEK-ERK signaling pathway,2015,Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common primary malignant brain tumor and has a poor prognosis. We here report a potent antitumor effect of berberine an isoquinoline alkaloid on GBM. Berberine was found to have an IC50 that is much lower than temozolomide in vitro in U87 U251 and U118 glioblastoma cells. Although previous studies showed that berberine primarily exerts its anticancer effect by inducing cell-cycle arrest apoptosis and autophagy we observed that the antitumor effect of berberine on glioblastoma cells was primarily achieved through induction of cellular senescence. In glioblastoma cells treated with berberine the level of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) was greatly reduced. Examination of the activities of the kinases downstream of EGFR revealed that the RAF-MEK-ERK signaling pathway was remarkably inhibited whereas AKT phosphorylation was not altered. Pharmacologic inhibition or RNA interference of EGFR similarly induced cellular senescence of glioblastoma cells. Furthermore the cellular senescence induced by berberine could be rescued by introduction of a constitutive active MKK. Berberine also potently inhibited the growth of tumor xenografts which was accompanied by downregulation of EGFR and induction of senescence. Our findings thus revealed a new route by which berberine exerts its anticancer activity. Because EGFR is commonly upregulated in glioblastoma the demonstration of effective inhibition of EGFR by berberine points to the possibility of using berberine in the treatment of patients with glioblastoma.,,Changshun ,,10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-14-0634,,Is this publication relevent to this project?,
7ba08973-3e16-4efc-9798-31af0a6ee129,Improved effects of honokiol on temozolomide-induced autophagy and apoptosis of drug-sensitive and -tolerant glioma cells,2018,BACKGROUND: Temozolomide (TMZ)-induced side effects and drug tolerance to human gliomas are still challenging issues now. Our previous studies showed that honokiol a major bioactive constituent of Magnolia officinalis (Houpo) is safe for normal brain cells and can kill human glioma cells. This study was further aimed to evaluate the improved effects of honokiol and TMZ on drug-sensitive and -resistant glioma cells and the possible mechanisms. METHODS: TMZ-sensitive human U87-MG and murine GL261 glioma cells and TMZ-resistant human U87-MR-R9 glioma cells were exposed to honokiol and TMZ and cell viability and LC50 of honokiol were assayed. To determine the death mechanisms caspase-3 activity DNA fragmentation apoptotic cells necrotic cells cell cycle and autophagic cells. The glioma cells were pretreated with 3-methyladenine (3-MA) and chloroquine (CLQ) two inhibitors of autophagy and then exposed to honokiol or TMZ. RESULTS: Exposure of human U87-MG glioma cells to honokiol caused cell death and significantly enhanced TMZ-induced insults. As to the mechanism combined treatment of human U87-MG cells with honokiol and TMZ induced greater caspase-3 activation DNA fragmentation cell apoptosis and cell-cycle arrest at the G(1) phase but did not affect cell necrosis. The improved effects of honokiol on TMZ-induced cell insults were further verified in mouse GL261 glioma cells. Moreover exposure of drug-tolerant human U87-MG-R9 cells to honokiol induced autophagy and consequent apoptosis. Pretreatments with 3-MA and CLQ caused significant attenuations in honokiol- and TMZ-induced cell autophagy and apoptosis in human TMZ-sensitive and -tolerant glioma cells. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together this study demonstrated the improved effects of honokiol with TMZ on autophagy and subsequent apoptosis of drug-sensitive and -tolerant glioma cells. Thus honokiol has the potential to be a drug candidate for treating human gliomas.,,Ruei-Ming ,,10.1186/s12885-018-4267-z,,Is this publication relevent to this project?,

All products were evaluated by several spectroscopic techniques (Raman UV-Vis) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Besides for therapeutic purposes the effect of these nanoparticles on cell proliferation and toxicity was evaluated which clearly showed a synergic action of TMZ and GEM. Through the analysis of the exometabolome by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) the metabolic changes in the culture medium were measured in glial cells. Moreover these nanoparticles are especially appropriated to the thermal destruction of cancer in the case of photothermal therapy due to their photothermal heating properties. This study presents an original chemical approach that it could play a central role in the field of nanomedicine with novel perspectives for the development of new drugs and active targeting in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) cancer therapy.,,J ,,10.1021/acs.jmedchem.0c00694,,Is this publication relevent to this project?,

Hence in order to research these cells we treated temozolomide (TMZ)-sensitive U87MG cells with 400 mu M TMZ in culture media for over 6 months and established TMZ-resistant cell line designated as U87/TR. We detected the MGMT status through pyrosequencing and western blotting and we also assessed the proliferation migration EMT-like changes and possible activated signaling pathways in U87/TR cells. Our results demonstrated that U87/TR was MGMT negative which indicated that MGMT made no contribution for TMZ-resistance of U87/TR. And U87/TR cells displayed cell cycle arrest higher capacity for migration and EMT-like changes including both phenotype and characteristic proteins. We also revealed that both beta-catenin and the phosphorylation level of Akt and PRAS40 were increased in U87/TR while we did not observe the phosphorylation of mTOR in U87/TR. It indicated that activation of Akt and Wnt/beta-catenin pathways may be response for the chemo-resistance and increased invasion of U87/TR cells and the phosphorylation of PRAS40 and inactivated mTOR may be related to cell cycle arrest in U87/TR cells.

The microspheres were fabricated by the [']Solid/Water/Oil['] method and they were characterized by using X-Ray diffraction scanning electron microscopy and differential scanning calorimetry. The proliferation apoptosis and invasion of glioma cells were evaluated by MTT flow cytometry assay and Transwell assay. The presence of the key invasive gene alpha(V)beta 3 integrin was detected by the RT-PCR and Western blot method. It was found that the temozolomide/PLGA/nano-hydroxyapatite microspheres have a significantly diminished initial burst of drug release compared to the TMZ laden PLGA microspheres. Our results suggest they can significantly inhibit the proliferation and invasion of glioma cells and induce their apoptosis. Additionally alpha(V)beta 3 integrin was also reduced by the microspheres. These data suggest that by inhibiting the biological behavior of glioma cells in vitro the newly designed temozolomide/PLGA/nano-hydroxyapatite microspheres as controlled drug release carriers have promising potential in treating glioma.,,Anhua ,,10.3390/ijms13011109,,Is this publication relevent to this project?,
80398bfb-8a23-4516-aea7-4b3ceb04b11e,Cytotoxicity of temozolomide on human glioblastoma cells is enhanced by the concomitant exposure to an extremely low-frequency electromagnetic field (100 Hz 100 G),2017,Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most malignant brain cancer that causes high mortality in humans. It responds poorly to the most common cancer treatments such as surgery chemo- and radiation therapy. Temozolomide (TMZ) is an alkylating agent that has been widely used to treat GBM; resistance to this drug is often found. One unexplored possibility for overcoming this resistance is a treatment based on concomitant exposure to electromagnetic fields (EMF) and TMZ. Indeed many evidences show that EMF affects cancer cells and drug performance. In this study we evaluated the potential synergistic effect of 100 muM TMZ and EMF (100 Hz 100 G) on two human glioma cells line i.e. U87 and T98G above single treatments TMZ or EMF. Co-treatment synergistically enhanced apoptosis in U87 and T98G cells by increasing the expression of P53 Bax and Caspase-3 and decreasing that of Bcl-2 and Cyclin-D1. We also observed an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and the overexpression of the heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) gene in comparison to controls. In conclusion since EMF enhanced the apoptotic effect of TMZ possibly through a redox regulation mechanism the TMZ/EMF combination may be effective for glioma cancer treating. Further studies are needed to reveal the action mechanism of this possible novel therapeutic approach.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS,,M ,,10.1016/j.biopha.2017.05.050,,Is this publication relevent to this project?,
80cf2e66-618b-4630-affb-a1acb578a68c,In vitro novel combinations of psychotropics and anti-cancer modalities in U87 human glioblastoma cells,2010,Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a highly aggressive malignant brain tumor. Despite some recent improvement in the treatment of this malignancy life expectancy of GBM patients remains extremely low. Therefore continuous efforts to develop new treatment modalities are mandatory. A novel approach to cancer treatment is the use of targeted treatments alone and in combination with other therapies. In this study we evaluated the effects of novel combinations of conventional anti-cancer treatments (temozolomide or irradiation) with the targeted drug imatinib or with psychotropic drugs belonging to the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and phenothiazine subclasses as well as combination of imatinib with psychotropic agents on a human U87 glioblastoma cell line. The combination of temozolomide with imatinib or the psychotropic drugs resulted in an additive anti-proliferative effect while the combination of irradiation and the psychotropic agents resulted in a less than additive effect on cell proliferation. A marked synergistic anti-proliferative effect of imatinib combined with the psychotropic drugs fluoxetine sertraline or perphenazine was demonstrated. None of the single or combined treatments led to a reduction in the expression of phosphorylated MAP kinase. However a marked synergistic reduction in the expression of the key regulatory molecule pAKT was detected following the combined treatment of the cells with the imatinib/psychotropics combination. This down-regulation of pAKT may mediate the synergistic anti-proliferative interaction of imatinib with the psychotropic agents. Although the concentrations of the psychotropic agents used in this and other in vitro studies were beyond the clinically relevant blood levels in humans recent studies have demonstrated anti-proliferative effects in vivo using sertraline in a human colon cancer model. Thus it seems that further in vivo studies combining imatinib with psychotropic agents especially fluoxetine and sertraline are warranted.,,J ,,10.3892/ijo-00000756,,Is this publication relevent to this project?,
834ae41e-f179-4f5a-bb48-42c40a03f874,Enhancing glioblastoma cell sensitivity to chemotherapeutics: A strategy involving survivin gene silencing mediated by gemini surfactant-based complexes,2016,Glioblastoma (GBM) the highest grade astrocytoma is one of the most aggressive and challenging cancers to treat. The standard treatment is usually limited due to the intrinsic resistance of GBM to chemotherapy and drug non-specific effects. Therefore new therapeutic strategies need to be developed to target tumor cells sparing healthy tissues. In this context the inhibitor-of-apoptosis protein (IAP) survivin emerges as an ideal target for a gene silencing approach since it is sharply differentially expressed in cancer tissues. In this work two different families of cationic gemini surfactants (bis-quat conventional and serine-derived) were tested regarding their efficiency to deliver small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) in a human GBM cell line (U87) in order to select an effective siRNA anti-survivin carrier. Importantly survivin downregulation combined with administration of the chemotherapeutic agents temozolomide or etoposide resulted in a synergistic cytotoxic effect thus revealing to be a promising strategy to reduce the chemotherapeutic doses for GBM treatment.,,S ,,10.1016/j.ejpb.2016.04.014,,Is this publication relevent to this project?,

Glioma stem-like cells (GSCs) are thought to be responsible for the drug resistance. In this study we investigate whether endothelial monocyte-activating polypeptide-II (EMAP-II) a pro-inflammatory cytokine can enhance TMZ cytotoxicity on U87MG and GSCs or not. As described in prior research GSCs have been isolated from U87MG and maintained in the serum-free DMEM/F12 medium containing EGF b-FGF and B27. TMZ and/or EMAP-II administration were performed for 72 h respectively. The results showed that TMZ combined with EMAP-II inhibit the proliferation of U87MG and GSCs by a larger measure than TMZ single treatment by decreasing the IC(50). EMAP-II also enhanced TMZ-induced autophagy-mediated cell death and G2/M arrest. Moreover we found that EMAP-II functioned a targeted suppression on mTOR which may involve in the anti-neoplasm mechanism. The results suggest that EMAP-II could be considered as a combined chemotherapeutic agent against glioblastoma by sensitizing U87MG and GSCs to TMZ.,,Yunhui ,,10.1080/15384101.2017.1315492,,Is this publication relevent to this project?,
8582d8bc-9eb7-46e0-8548-a01926786db6,MicroRNA-182 targets protein phosphatase 1 regulatory inhibitor subunit 1C in glioblastoma,2017,Glioblastoma (GBM) is an incurable cancer with mean post-diagnosis survival time of 14-16 months. Metagenomic analysis by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) program has identified microRNA-182-5p (miR-182-5p or miR-182) as the only miRNA associated with favorable disease prognosis and temozolomide (TMZ) susceptibility. Previous reports have indicated that miR-182 down regulates expression of BCL2L12 c-MET and HIF2A. However other messenger RNA (mRNA) targets of miR-182 have not been validated which would explain its association with a favorable disease prognosis. In situ analysis revealed that protein phosphatase 1 regulatory inhibitor subunit 1C (PPP1R1C) is a putative target of miR-182. PPP1R1C protein and RNA expression as assessed by tissue microarray and quantitative real time PCR respectively was inversely correlated to miR-182 expression in glioblastoma patients and in the metastatic glioblastoma cell line U87-MG. Reporter assays using PPP1R1C 3' untranslated region (UTR) showed that miR-182 can interact with the wild-type but not a miR-182-5-seed mutant. Ectopic expression of miR-182 mimic in the U87-MG cell line significantly decreased proliferation as well as suppressed in vitro migration and invasion. Opposite observations were made when the non-malignant neuronal cell line HCN-2 was transfected with anti-miR-182 antagomir. The miR- 182 mimic or siRNA targeting PPP1R1C induced TMZ susceptibility indicating that decreased susceptibility to TMZ in GBM patients might be attributed to high expression of PPP1R1C. Inverse correlation of PPP1R1C mRNA and miR-182 levels in 20 GBM patients confirmed the same. Cumulatively our results indicate that loss of miR-182 leads to increased expression of PPP1R1C which in part explain disease progression and resistance to TMZ therapy.Copyright © Liu et al.,,Z ,,10.18632/oncotarget.21309,,Is this publication relevent to this project?,

For this purpose the human GBM cell lines U251 and U87 were transfected with a miR-31 precursor (pre-miR-31) and cell proliferation apoptosis and STAT3 phosphorylation were then assessed. To evaluate the effects of miR-31 on TMZ cytotoxicity the cells were transfected with pre-miR-31 and exposed to 100 mu M TMZ for 72 h prior to cell proliferation and apoptosis analysis. A constitutively active STAT3 mutant was co-transfected with pre-miR-31 into the cells to confirm the mediating role of STAT3 signaling. The enforced expression of miR-31 significantly reduced cell proliferation and induced mitochondrial apoptosis as manifested by the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and the increase in caspase-9 and caspase-3 activity. The phosphorylation level of STAT3 was significantly decreased by the overexpression of miR-31. The co-delivery of the constitutively active STAT3 mutant blocked the tumor suppressive effects of miR-31. In addition miR-31 overexpression significantly enhanced the cytotoxic effects of TMZ on the GBM cells as evidenced by the accelerated suppression of cell proliferation and the induction of apoptosis. The chemosensitizing effects of miR-31 were significantly impaired by the expression of the constitutively active STAT3 mutant. Taken together our results indicate that miR-31 triggers mitochondrial apoptosis and potentiates TMZ cytotoxicity in GBM cells largely through the suppression of STAT3 activation. Thus the restoration of miR-31 expression may be of therapeutic beenefit in the treatment of GBM.,,Wen-Hua ,,10.3892/ijmm.2015.2312,,Is this publication relevent to this project?,
876b771f-94ec-4ecc-b3e7-6816e2c1ef0d,Effect of the STAT3 inhibitor STX-0119 on the proliferation of a temozolomide-resistant glioblastoma cell line,2014,Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is one of the most malignant and aggressive tumors and has a very poor prognosis with a median survival time of less than 2 years. Once recurrence develops there are few therapeutic approaches to control the growth of glioblastoma. In particular temozolomide (TMZ)- resistant (TMZ-R) GBM is very difficult to treat and a novel approach to overcome resistance is eagerly awaited. Previously we reported a novel small molecule inhibitor of STAT3 dimerization STX-0119 as a cancer therapeutic. In the current study the efficacy of STX-0119 was evaluated against our established TMZ-resistant U87 cell line using quantitative PCR-based gene expression analysis in vitro assay and animal experiments. The growth inhibitory effect of STX-0119 on U87 and TMZ-R U87 cells was moderate (IC50 34 and 45 muM respectively). In particular STX-0119 did not show significant inhibition of U87 tumor growth; however it suppressed the growth of the TMZ-R U87 tumor in nude mice by more than 50% and prolonged the median survival time compared to the control group. Quantitative PCR revealed that YKL-40 MAGEC1 MGMT several EMT genes mesenchymal genes and STAT3 target genes were upregulated but most of those genes were downregulated by STX-0119 treatment. Furthermore the invasive activity of TMZ-R U87 cells was significantly inhibited by STX-0119. YKL-40 levels in TMZ-R U87 cells and their supernatants were significantly decreased by STX-0119 administration. These results suggest that STX-0119 is an efficient therapeutic to overcome TMZ resistance in recurrent GBM tumors and could be the next promising compound leading to survival prolongation and YKL-40 may be a possible surrogate marker for STAT3 targeting.,,K ,,10.3892/ijo.2014.2439,,Is this publication relevent to this project?,
8b4d0dcb-d4b4-4e7c-87d6-7e2b52f5a1ad,Potentiation of antiglioma effect with combined temozolomide and interferon-beta,2006,Temozolomide (TMZ) is a DNA methylating agent that has shown promising antitumor activity against high grade glioma. Interferon-beta (IFN-beta) is known to have antiproliferative and antiangiogenic activities. The aim of this study was to elucidate whether an antiglioma effect could be potentiated by the combination of TMZ and IFN-beta. In vitro the combination of these drugs suppressed the proliferative and migratory activities as well as enhance of the apoptosis and cell cycle (S phase) arrest of U-87 cells more efficiently than TMZ or IFN-beta alone. IFN-beta exerted a potent inhibitory effect on the proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC); however no additive or synergistic effect was observed with the addition of TMZ. To determine in vivo effect nude mice bearing intracerebral U-87 xenograft inoculation were treated with intraperitoneal administration of PBS TMZ (15 mg/kg for 3 days) IFN-beta (2x10(5) IU for 15 days) and a TMZ + IFN-beta combination. The combined treatment (median 62.0+/-8.6 days P=0.0005) was observed to significantly increase the survival of the animals compared to treatment with PBS (median 30.0+/-2.5 days) TMZ (median 41.0+/-3.5 days) or IFN-beta (mean 36.0+/-2.5 days). These results suggest that antiglioma activity can be enhanced by the combination of TMZ and IFN-beta providing the possibility for a new strategy development in the management of malignant glioma.,,K ,,NA,,Is this publication relevent to this project?,
8d176ce8-1e76-49b8-b100-e1bc1e3f3b48,The Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway confers glioma resistance to DNA alkylating agents,2007,DNA alkylating agents including temozolomide (TMZ) and 13-bis[2-chloroethyl]-1-nitroso-urea (BCNU) are the most common form of chemotherapy in the treatment of gliomas. Despite their frequent use the therapeutic efficacy of these agents is limited by the development of resistance. Previous studies suggest that the mechanism of this resistance is complex and involves multiple DNA repair pathways. To better define the pathways contributing to the mechanisms underlying glioma resistance we tested the contribution of the Fanconi anemia (FA) DNA repair pathway. TMZ and BCNU treatment of FA-proficient cell lines led to a dose- and time-dependent increase in FANCD2 mono-ubiquitination and FANCD2 nuclear foci formation both hallmarks of FA pathway activation. The FA-deficient cells were more sensitive to TMZ/BCNU relative to their corrected isogenic counterparts. To test whether these observations were pertinent to glioma biology we screened a panel of glioma cell lines and identified one (HT16) that was deficient in the FA repair pathway. This cell line exhibited increased sensitivity to TMZ and BCNU relative to the FA-proficient glioma cell lines. Moreover inhibition of FA pathway activation by a small molecule inhibitor (curcumin) or by small interference RNA suppression caused increased sensitivity to TMZ/BCNU in the U87 glioma cell line. The BCNU sensitizing effect of FA inhibition appeared additive to that of methyl-guanine methyl transferase inhibition. The results presented in this paper underscore the complexity of cellular resistance to DNA alkylating agents and implicate the FA repair pathway as a determinant of this resistance.,,Alan ,,10.1007/s00109-006-0153-2,,Is this publication relevent to this project?,
8d78f09a-3674-4b23-8792-b537161f8f18,Chemotherapeutic effect of tamoxifen on temozolomide-resistant gliomas,2015,Tamoxifen a selective estrogen receptor modulator is widely used in the chemotherapy of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. Recent studies have indicated that tamoxifen might have a potential chemotherapeutic effect on glioma. In the present study we determined the chemotherapeutic action of tamoxifen on human glioma cell lines. Methylation of 06-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase was identified in A172 U251 and BT325 glioma cell lines but not in the U87 cell line. Consistently A172 U251 and BT325 cell lines are resistant to temozolomide. Tamoxifen induced significant cytotoxic action in A172 U251 BT325 and U87 cell lines. Further Hoechst 33342 staining and apoptosis flow cytometric analysis demonstrated that tamoxifen induced apoptosis in the BT325 cell line. Mitochondrial complex analysis indicated that tamoxifen but not other estrogen receptor modulators dose-dependently inhibits complex I activity. In summary our study suggests that tamoxifen might have a chemotherapeutic effect on temozolomide-resistant glioma through its direct action on mitochondrial complex I inhibition and could provide further evidence to support future clinical trials of tamoxifen for the treatment of glioblastoma.,,Fang ,,10.1097/CAD.0000000000000197,,Is this publication relevent to this project?,
8e52ddfb-c81e-4de0-b9ca-2e45968c1258,Chronic exposure of human glioblastoma tumors to low concentrations of a pesticide mixture induced multidrug resistance against chemotherapy agents,2020,Recent evidence indicates that chronic low-dose exposure to mixtures of pesticides can cause adverse responses in a variety of cells tissues and organs although interactions between pesticides circulating in the blood and cancer cells remain largely unexplored. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential of a mixture of four pesticides to induce multidrug resistance against the chemotherapeutic agents cisplatin 5-fluorouracil and temozolomide in the human U87 glioblastoma cell line and to explore the molecular mechanisms underlying this resistance. We found that the repeated administration of the pesticide mixture (containing the insecticides chlorpyrifos-ethyl and deltamethrin the fungicide metiram and the herbicide glyphosate) induced a strong drug resistance in U87 cells. The resistance was durable and transferred to subsequent cell generations. In addition we detected a significant over-expression of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) membrane transporters P-gp/ABCB1 and BRCP/ABCG2 as well as a glutathione-S-transferase (GST)/M1-type cellular detoxification function known to have important roles in multidrug resistance thus providing molecular support for the acquired multidrug resistance phenotype and shedding light on the mechanism of resistance. We further determined that there was lower mortality in the resistant brain tumor cells and that the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway was activated at a lower rate after chemotherapy compared to non-resistant control cells. In addition multidrug-resistant cells were found to have both higher motility and wound-healing properties suggesting a greater metastatic potential. Our results suggest that the investigation of P-gp BRCP and GST/M1 multidrug resistance gene expression and/or protein levels in biopsy specimens of brain tumor patients who were at risk of pesticide exposure could be beneficial in determining chemotherapy dose and prolonging patient survival.,,Seben ,,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2020.110940,,Is this publication relevent to this project?,
8eb6db64-5623-4300-b8b6-0cdd0b06e9cb,EGCG inhibits properties of glioma stem-like cells and synergizes with temozolomide through downregulation of P-glycoprotein inhibition,2015,Combination therapy to inhibit cancer stem cells may have important clinical implications. Here we examine the molecular mechanisms by which epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) a bioactive polyphenol in green tea inhibits the stem cell characteristics of glioma stem-like cells (GSLCs) and synergizes with temozolomide (TMZ) a DNA-methylating agent commonly used as first-line chemotherapy in gliomas. GSLCs were enriched from the human glioblastoma cell line U87 using neurosphere culture. Cells were analyzed using flow cytometry quantitative PCR and western blotting. Compared to U87 cells a higher percentage of U87 GSLCs remained in the G0/G1 phase with downregulation of the cell-cycle protein CylinD1 and overexpression of stem cell markers CD133 and ALDH1. The drug-resistance gene ABCB1 (but not ABCG2 or MGMT) also showed high mRNA and protein expression. The resistance index of U87 GSLCs against TMZ and carmustine (BCNU) was 3.0 and 16.8 respectively. These results indicate that U87 GSLCs possess neural stem cell and drug-resistance properties. Interestingly EGCG treatment inhibited cell viability neurosphere formation and migration in this cell model. EGCG also induced apoptosis downregulation of p-Akt and Bcl-2 and cleaving PARP in a dose-dependent manner. Importantly EGCG treatment significantly downregulated P-glycoprotein expression but not that of ABCG2 or MGMT and simultaneously enhanced sensitivity to TMZ. Our study demonstrates that the use of EGCG alone or in combination with TMZ may be an effective therapeutic strategy for glioma.,,Xue-Yun ,,10.1007/s11060-014-1604-1,,Is this publication relevent to this project?,
8f058d30-9af9-4f57-849d-8480d2ccc669,The mTOR inhibitor RAD001 potentiates autophagic cell death induced by temozolomide in a glioblastoma cell line,2013,We have studied the consequences of the combination of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor RAD001 and temozolomide on the growth and cell death of the glioblastoma cell line U-87 in vitro. A progressive decrease of cell proliferation was recorded with increasing concentrations of temozolomide which was markedly reinforced and prolonged by the addition of RAD001. While this combination treatment resulted in only a low level of apoptosis it led to a pronounced enhancement of autophagic cell death. When combined with gamma-ray irradiation a significant reinforcement of the overall cytotoxicity was obtained suggesting the efficacy of such a multipronged approach for the treatment of glioblastoma. RAD001 strongly contributes to the reinforcement of temozolomide-induced autophagy which appears to represent a major form of cell death in glioblastoma. The association of such combined chemotherapies with radiotherapy could be useful for the management of these hard-to-treat malignancies.,,P ,,NA,,Is this publication relevent to this project?,

Data about such use in glioblastoma is limited. Methods: Cultured U87-MG cells a primary glioblastoma cell line (MU1454) U87-MG derived stem-like cells (scU87) and MU1454 derived stem-like cell lines (scMU1454) were pre-treated with one of three anti-oxidants&mdash;Vitamin D₃ Melatonin and alpha-lipoic acid (LA)&mdash;for 72 h followed by a 72 h treatment with temozolomide (TMZ). MTT (3-(45-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-25-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assessed cell proliferation. DCFDA Cellular ROS Detection Assay and Glutathione peroxidase (GP&times;1) activity assessed the anti-oxidant effect of TMZ +/&minus; an anti-oxidant drug. Results: Vitamin D₃ did not affect MU1454 but had slight TMZ synergism for U87-MG. Melatonin 1 mM decreased U87-MG and MU1454 cell proliferation. As pretreatment to TMZ melatonin 1 mM and 50 nM significantly reduced proliferation. LA 1 mM had a significant effect alone or with TMZ on U87-MG and MU1454. LA 250 uM also reduced proliferation by almost 50%. Melatonin and LA significantly enhanced the responsiveness of scMU1454 to TMZ while Melatonin 50 nM exerted similar effects on scU87. The anti-oxidants were associated with generally decreased reactive oxygen species and limited GP&times;1 effects. Conclusions: Anti-oxidants may have synergistic effects with TMZ.

938fc84c-1056-490c-9170-6aeba6897d98,Inhibition of telomerase activity in malignant glioma cells correlates with their sensitivity to temozolomide,2003,Temozolomide (TMZ 34-dihydro-3-methyl-4-oxoimidazo [51-d]-as-tetrazine-8-carboxamide) is a new alkylating agent with promising antitumour efficacy for malignant gliomas. The resistance of tumour cells to TMZ is primarily associated with levels of the alkylguanine alkyltransferase (AGT). O-6-benzylguanine (O-6-BG) an inhibitor for AGT reduced resistance to TMZ. Recently it has been demonstrated that chemosensitivity of tumour cells is related to a decline in telomerase activity. However it is unknown if TMZ sensitivity of malignant glioma cells correlates with telomerase. In this study using malignant glioma cells with low levels of AGT (U373-MG and U87-MG) and high levels of AGT (T98G) we investigated the association among AGT telomerase and TMZ sensitivity. U373-MG and U87-MG cells were sensitive to TMZ ( IC50 for a 2-day treatment = 100 muM) while T98G cells were resistant to TMZ (IC50 for a 2-day treatment >500 muM). Treatment with TMZ (100 muM) suppressed telomerase activity in U373-MG and U87-MG cells in a time-dependent manner but not in T98G cells. The downregulation of telomerase activity in U373-MG and U87-MG cells was due to inhibition of the human telomerase reverse-transcriptase ( hTERT) gene expression at the transcriptional level. This inhibitory effect was induced by interfering with transcription factor Sp1 binding sites of the hTERT core promoter. Interestingly O-6-BG not only sensitised T98G cells to TMZ but also suppressed telomerase activity. These findings suggest that response of malignant glioma cells to TMZ can be monitored by reduction in telomerase activity. Therefore quantification of telomerase activity during or after treatment with TMZ may be a useful marker to detect treatment efficacy.,,S ,,10.1038/sj.bjc.6601193,,Is this publication relevent to this project?,

Here we established mechanism by which Phenethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC) reverses TMD resistance in T98G cell lines both in vitro and in vivo. Method(s): For the study TMD-resistant cell lines were generated by stepwise exposing the parental cell lines (U87 and U373) to TMD. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) values were established. MTT assay was done for cell survival studies apoptosis assay by FITC Annexin V/PI staining luciferase reporter assay for NF-kappaB transcription activity cell colony survival and cell invasion assay protein expression by western blot was done. For in vivo studies nude mouse model of GBM was established TUNEL assay was done for apoptosis in tumor specimens. Result(s): We established that T98G U87-R and U373-R showed higher NF-kappaB activity and exhibited higher IC50 of TMD with significantly increased MGMT expression compared to untreated cells. Next we found that PEITC suppressed proliferation of resistant GBM cells inhibited NF-kappaB activity decreased expression of MGMT and reversed the resistance in U373-R U87-R and T98G cells. Exposure to PEITC followed by sequential treatment of TMD produced synergistic effect. In U373-R grafted xenografts mouse model PEITC suppressed cell growth and enhanced cell death. Conclusion(s): Altogether the present research established that combination of PEITC with TMD could enhance its clinical efficacy in resistant GBM by suppressing MGMT via inhibiting NF-kappaB activity.Copyright © 2019 E-Century Publishing Corporation.

PURPOSE: In this study we examined the modulatory effect of Ova on the oncogenicity proliferation and cancer stem cell-like traits of glioblastoma (GBM) cells as well as investigated the underlying molecular mechanism for the anticancer activity of Ova in GBM cell lines U-87MG and GBM8401. METHODS: The antiproliferative apoptotic and stemness-attenuating effects of Ova were evaluated using the sulforhodamine B (SRB) colorimetric assay western blot and fluorescent immunocytochemistry. Cell apoptosis was analyzed based on variation in the expression levels of Bcl-2 family of regulator proteins Bax Bak Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. RESULTS: Ova induced the apoptosis of the U-87MG and GBM8401 cells as well as effectively inhibited the proliferation and motility of the GBM cell lines in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Ova-induced apoptosis correlated with increased Bax/Bcl-2 ratio while inhibition of tumor cell migration and colony formation was associated with reduced Slug Vimentin NCadherin and β-catenin protein expression and increased E-Cadherin. In addition exposure to Ova inhibited tumorsphere formation elicited downregulation of CD44 CD133 Sox2 and Oct4 as well as correlated with dysregulation of the JAK2-STAT3 signaling pathway. Furthermore we showed for the first time to the best of our knowledge that Ova potentiate the chemotherapeutic effect of Temozolomide. CONCLUSION: Taken together our findings demonstrate the anticancer potential of Ova in GBM and its efficacy in the treatment of GBM as monotherapy and in combination with Temozolomide.,,Chien-Min ,,10.1016/j.phymed.2019.152840,,Is this publication relevent to this project?,

The aim of this study is to investigate the synergistic effects of honokiol (Hono) and magnolol (Mag) extracted from Magnolia officinalis on cytotoxicity and inhibition of human GBM tumor progression in cellular and animal models. In comparison with Hono or Mag alone co-treatment with Hono and Mag (Hono-Mag) decreased cyclin A D1 and cyclin-dependent kinase 2 4 6 significantly leading to cell cycle arrest in U87MG and LN229 human glioma cells. In addition phosphorylated phosphoinositide 3-kinase (p-PI3K) p-Akt and Ki67 were decreased after Hono-Mag treatment showing proliferation inhibition. Hono-Mag treatment also reduced p-p38 and p-JNK but elevated p-ERK expression. Besides Hono-Mag treatment induced autophagy and intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis. Both ERK and autophagy inhibitors enhanced Hono- Mag-induced apoptosis in LN229 cells indicating a rescuer role of ERK. In human GBM orthotopic xenograft model the Hono-Mag treatment inhibited the tumor progression and induced apoptosis more efficiently than Temozolomide Hono or Mag group. In conclusion the Hono-Mag exerts a synergistic anti-tumor effect by inhibiting cell proliferation and inducing autophagy and apoptosis in human GBM cells. The Hono-Mag may be applied as an adjuvant therapy to improve the therapeutic efficacy of GBM treatment.,,Y ,,10.18632/oncotarget.8674,,Is this publication relevent to this project?,

High plasma IGFBP-2 levels are correlated with poor prognosis in glioma patients. However the exact role of exogenous IGFBP-2 in gliomas is unclear. Methods and results: Using the MTT cell viability assay cell cycle analysis and the transwell migration assay it was demonstrated that IGFBP-2 treatment stimulated proliferation and invasion in U87 and U251 cell lines and primary SU3 glioma cells. Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence staining revealed that IGFBP-2 promoted ERK phosphorylation and nuclear translocation. Moreover blocking ERK activation using the inhibitor PD98059 markedly reduced the effects of IGFBP-2 in glioma cells. As IGFBP-2 has an integrin-binding domain the contribution of integrin beta 1 to these IGFBP-2-mediated processes was examined. Neutralisation or knockdown of the expression of integrin beta 1 inhibited IGFBP-2-induced ERK activation cell proliferation and cell invasion. Significantly IGFBP-2 induced temozolomide resistance in glioma cells in an integrin beta 1/ERK-dependent manner. Conclusions: Exogenous IGFBP-2 induces proliferation invasion and chemoresistance in glioma cells via integrin beta 1/ERK signaling suggesting that targeting this pathway could represent a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of gliomas. The identification of this pathway in glioma progression provides insight into the mechanism by which serum IGFBP-2 levels can predict the prognosis of glioma patients.,,A ,,10.1038/bjc.2014.435,,Is this publication relevent to this project?,

However the mechanism by which Tim-3 suppresses antitumor treatment in gliomas remains unclear. This study aims to explore whether Tim-3 is expressed and to evaluate its effect in drug-fasted glioma cells. Subjects and Methods: U87 and U251 glioma cell lines were tested. Cell proliferation activity cell viability and the protein and mRNA levels of Tim-3 were detected using CCK-8 flow cytometry Western blotting and reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction respectively. Enhancement of the sensitivity of glioma cells to chemotherapeutic agents was tested after inhibiting Tim-3 expression using Tim-3 small interfering RNAs (siRNA). Results: As temozolomide (TMZ) concentration increased the ratio of apoptotic cells also increased accordingly. However the level of Tim-3 expression in living cells from the high-dose group was higher than in the low- and middle-dose groups. After interfering with the expression of Tim-3 using siRNA against Tim-3 the killing effect of TMZ rose through an increase in apoptosis. Conclusions: The presence of Tim-3 mRNA and protein in glioma cells was detected.

9c00a515-5273-40a5-ac63-7c054612eb7b,Downregulation of Id2 increases chemosensitivity of glioma,2015,With its growth characteristic and chemoresistance glioblastoma is the most deadly brain tumor. Twenty-five core genes that influence the chemosensitivity of glioblastoma were screened in our previous experiments and Id2 the inhibitor of DNA binding 2 an oncogene encoding a helix-loop-helix protein was identified. The elevated expression levels of Id2 have been reported in several malignancies. The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of Id2 expression on the chemosensitivity of glioma cells. In this study Id2 expression was investigated in a malignant glioma cell line. Then we silenced the expression of Id2 with the highly specific posttranscriptional suppression of RNA interference (RNAi) in U87 cells. The changes in response to antitumor agents Me-CCNU VM26 and TMZ were evaluated by 3-(45-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-25-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Apoptosis was measured using an annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) apoptosis detection kit. The relationship between Id2 expression and caspase 3 was tested by RT-PCR and Western blot. This study demonstrated that Id2 was significantly upregulated in glioma tissues and Id2 correlated well with the advancement of glioma grade and a worse prognosis in response to temozolomide treatment. The RNAi-mediated decrease of Id2 expression enhanced chemosensitivity to Me-CCNU VM26 and TMZ in the U87 cell line. We further discovered that silencing of Id2 expression could promote apoptosis of glioblastoma cells which could be attributed to the fact that Id2 affects tumor cell chemosensitivity. Downregulation of the Id2 gene by RNAi could increase the chemosensitivity of glioblastoma cells. Id2 could be a good molecular target for glioblastoma gene therapy.,,Xinguang ,,10.1007/s13277-015-3055-5,,Is this publication relevent to this project?,

However GBM shows chemoresistance shortly after the initiation of treatment. In order to detect whether silencing of human protein phosphatase 1D magnesium dependent (PPM1D) gene could increase the effects of TMZ in glioma cells glioma cells U87-MG were infected with lentiviral shRNA vector targeting PPM1D silencing. After PPM1D silencing was established cells were treated with TMZ. The multiple functions of human glioma cells after PPM1D silencing and TMZ chemotherapy were detected by flow cytometry and MTT assay. Significantly differentially expressed genes were distinguished by microarray-based gene expression profiling and analyzed by gene pathway enrichment analysis and ontology assessment. Western blotting was used to establish the protein expression of the core genes. PPM1D gene silencing improves TMZ induced cell proliferation and induces cell apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. When PPM1D gene silencing combined with TMZ was performed in glioma cells 367 genes were upregulated and 444 genes were downregulated compared with negative control. The most significant differential expression pathway was pathway in cancer and IGFR1R PIK3R1 MAPK8 and EP300 are core genes in the network. Western blotting showed that MAPK8 and PIK3R1 protein expression levels were upregulated and RB1 protein expression was decreased. It was consistent with that detected in gene expression profiling. In conclusion PPM1D gene silencing combined with TMZ eradicates glioma cells through cell apoptosis and cell cycle arrest.

9c7f4cfe-7de6-45e2-839d-ce5d52981e69,Inhibition of STAT3 reverses alkylator resistance through modulation of the AKT and beta-catenin signaling pathways,2011,Activation of signal transducer and activator of trans- cription 3 (STAT3) is associated with poor clinical outcome of glioblastoma (GBM). However the role of STAT3 in resistance to alkylator-based chemotherapy remains unknown. Here we retrospectively analyzed the phosphorylated STAT3 (p-STAT3) profile of 68 GBM patients receiving alkylator therapy identifying p-STAT3 as an independent unfavorable prognostic factor for progression-free and overall survival. Additionally elevated p-STAT3 expression correlated with resistance to alkylator therapy. In vitro analysis revealed that U251 and U87 human glioma cells were refractory to treatment with the common alkylating agent temozolomide (TMZ) with only a modest impact on AKT and beta-catenin activation in the context of high p-STAT3. Inhibition of STAT3 in these cells significantly enhanced the effect of TMZ. Inhibition of STAT3 dramatically decreased the IC50 of TMZ increasing TMZ-induced apoptosis while up-regulating expression of Bcl-2 and down-regulating expression of Bax. Furthermore inhibition of STAT3 increased TMZ-induced G0-G1 arrest and decreased Cyclin D1 expression compared to TMZ alone. Together these results indicate that inhibition of STAT3 sensitizes glioma cells to TMZ at least in part by blocking the p-AKT and beta-catenin pathways. These findings strongly support the hypothesis that STAT3 inhibition significantly improves the clinical efficacy of alkylating agents.,,T ,,10.3892/or.2011.1396,,Is this publication relevent to this project?,
a3574ad4-c211-479d-8571-5abbe465fc44,Development of transferrin-modified poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) nanoparticles for glioma therapy,2019,Glioma is a primary intracranial malignant tumor with poor prognosis. In this study we aimed to develop transferrin (Tf)-modified poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles to deliver temozolomide (TMZ) to glioma and evaluate their efficacy to kill glioma. TMZ-loaded nanoparticles were prepared by nanoprecipitation technique and targeted by Tf. Tf-PLGA-TMZ and PLGA-TMZ were characterized for average particle sizes and zeta potentials cellular uptake and cytotoxicity as well as in-vitro drug release of these nanoparticles were evaluated in human glioma U87MG cells. In-vivo antiglioma efficacy of Tf-PLGA-TMZ was evaluated in nude mice. Polydispersity ratio increased from 0.132 to 0.150 while encapsulation efficiency decreased from 69.4 to 55.8% after Tf modification of PLGA-TMZ. High performance liquid chromatography test showed that Tf-targeted nanoparticles were better internalized into U87MG cells than nontargeted nanoparticles. Moreover Tf-PLGA-TMZ significantly decreased the viability of U87MG cells compared with nontargeted nanoparticles (P<0.05). In addition Tf-PLGA-TMZ significantly decreased tumor volume and improved the survival of nude mice injected with U87MG cells. Tf-modified PLGA nanoparticles could be used for effective delivery of TMZ and have promise for the treatment of glioma.,,Guodong ,,10.1097/CAD.0000000000000754,,Is this publication relevent to this project?,
a5713d3e-4825-4375-a2f2-505c35ea44f0,Riluzole enhances the antitumor effects of temozolomide via suppression of MGMT expression in glioblastoma,2020,OBJECTIVE: Glutamatergic signaling significantly promotes proliferation migration and invasion in glioblastoma (GBM). Riluzole a metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 inhibitor reportedly suppresses GBM growth. However the effects of combining riluzole with the primary GBM chemotherapeutic agent temozolomide (TMZ) are unknown. This study aimed to investigate the efficacy of combinatorial therapy with TMZ/riluzole for GBM in vitro and in vivo. METHOD(S): Three GBM cell lines T98G (human; O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase [MGMT] positive) U87MG (human; MGMT negative) and GL261 (murine; MGMT positive) were treated with TMZ riluzole or a combination of both. The authors performed cell viability assays followed by isobologram analysis to evaluate the effects of combinatorial treatment for each GBM cell line. They tested the effect of riluzole on MGMT a DNA repair enzyme causing chemoresistance to TMZ through quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction in T98G cells. Furthermore they evaluated the efficacy of combinatorial TMZ/riluzole treatment in an orthotopic mouse allograft model of MGMT-positive GBM using C57BL/6 J mice and GL261 cells. RESULT(S): Riluzole displayed significant time- and dose-dependent growth-inhibitory effects on all GBM cell lines assessed independently. Riluzole enhanced the antitumor effect of TMZ synergistically in MGMT-positive but not in MGMT-negative GBM cell lines. Riluzole singularly suppressed MGMT expression and it significantly suppressed TMZ-induced MGMT upregulation (p < 0.01). Furthermore combinatorial TMZ/riluzole treatment significantly suppressed tumor growth in the intracranial MGMT-positive GBM model (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION(S): Riluzole attenuates TMZ-induced MGMT upregulation and enhances the antitumor effect of TMZ in MGMT-positive GBMs. Therefore combinatorial TMZ/riluzole treatment is a potentially promising novel therapeutic regimen for MGMT-positive GBMs.,,H ,,10.3171/2019.12.JNS192682,,Is this publication relevent to this project?,
a603ced9-8fb2-49e2-9c07-c294427d5047,Bortezomib inhibits growth and sensitizes glioma to temozolomide (TMZ) via down-regulating the FOXM1-Survivin axis,2019,Background: High-grade glioma (HGG) is a fatal human cancer. Bortezomib a proteasome inhibitor has been approved for the treatment of multiple myeloma but its use in glioma awaits further investigation. This study aimed to explore the chemotherapeutic effect and the underlying mechanism of bortezomib on gliomas. Method(s): U251 and U87 cell viability and proliferation were detected by 3-(45-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-25-diphenyl-2-H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay tumor cell spheroid growth and colony formation assay. Cell apoptosis and cell cycle were detected by flow cytometry. Temozolomide (TMZ)-insensitive cell lines were induced by long-term TMZ treatment and cells with stem cell characteristics were enriched with stem cell culture medium. The mRNA levels of interested genes were measured via reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and protein levels were determined via Western blotting/immunofluorescent staining in cell lines and immunohistochemical staining in paraffin-embedded sections. Via inoculating U87 cells subcutaneously glioma xenograft models in nude mice were established for drug experiments. Patient survival data were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Result(s): Bortezomib inhibited the viability and proliferation of U251 and U87 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner by inducing apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. Bortezomib also significantly inhibited the spheroid growth colony formation and stem-like cell proliferation of U251 and U87 cells. When administrated in combination bortezomib showed synergistic effect with TMZ in vitro and sensitized glioma to TMZ treatment both in vitro and in vivo. Bortezomib reduced both the mRNA and protein levels of Forkhead Box M1 (FOXM1) and its target gene Survivin. The FOXM1-Survivin axis was markedly up-regulated in established TMZ-insensitive glioma cell lines and HGG patients. Expression levels of FOXM1 and Survivin were positively correlated with each other and both related to poor prognosis in glioma patients. Conclusion(s): Bortezomib was found to inhibit glioma growth and improved TMZ chemotherapy efficacy probably via down-regulating the FOXM1-Survivin axis. Bortezomib might be a promising agent for treating malignant glioma alone or in combination with TMZ.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).,,L Zhou,,10.1186/s40880-019-0424-2,,Is this publication relevent to this project?,

Such poor prognosis calls for a better understanding of cancer-related signaling pathways of this disease. Here we elucidate a MYC-miRNA-MXI1 feedback loop that regulates proliferation and tumorigenesis in glioma. MYC suppressed MXI1 expression via microRNA-155 (miR-155) and the microRNA-23a~27a~24-2 cluster (miR-23a cluster) whereas MXI1 in turn inhibited MYC expression by binding to its promoter. Overexpression of miR-155 and the miR-23a cluster promoted tumorigenesis in U87 glioma cells. Furthermore FTO an N6-methyladenosine (m6A) RNA demethylase regulated the loop by targeting MYC. The ethyl ester form of meclofenamic acid (MA2) inhibited FTO and enhanced the effect of the chemotherapy drug temozolomide (TMZ) on suppressing proliferation of glioma cells and negatively regulated the loop. These data collectively highlight a key regulatory circuit in glioma and provide potential targets for clinical treatment.,,Songshan ,,10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-20-0132,,Is this publication relevent to this project?,

A dual drug-loaded delivery system based on mPEG-PLGA nanoparticles (NPs) was developed to potentiate chemotherapy efficacy for glioblastoma. PTX/TMZ-NPs were prepared with double emulsification solvent evaporation method and exhibited a relatively uniform diameter of 206.3 +/- 14.7 nm. The NPs showed sustained release character. Cytotoxicity assays showed the best synergistic effects were achieved when the weight ratios of PTX to TMZ were 1: 5 and 1: 100 on U87 and C6 cells respectively. PTX/TMZ-NPs showed better inhibition effect to U87 and C6 cells than single drug NPs or free drugs mixture. PTX/TMZ-NPs (PTX: TMZ was 1: 5(w/w)) significantly inhibited the tumor growth in the subcutaneous U87 mice model. These results indicate that coordinate administration of PTX and TMZ combined with NPs is an efficient method for glioblastoma.,,Yourong ,,10.18632/oncotarget.7896,,Is this publication relevent to this project?,
a8ccfd07-4f6d-446e-97d8-a2fae50e8a6c,Afatinib and Temozolomide combination inhibits tumorigenesis by targeting EGFRvIII-cMet signaling in glioblastoma cells,2019,Background: Glioblastoma (GBM) is an aggressive brain tumor with universal recurrence and poor prognosis. The recurrence is largely driven by chemoradiation resistant cancer stem cells (CSCs). Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and its mutant EGFRvIII are amplified in ~ 60% and ~ 30% of GBM patients respectively; however therapies targeting EGFR have failed to improve disease outcome. EGFRvIII-mediated cross-activation of tyrosine kinase receptor cMET regulates GBM CSC maintenance and promote tumor recurrence. Here we evaluated the efficacy of pan-EGFR inhibitor afatinib and Temozolomide (TMZ) combination on GBM in vitro and in vivo. Method(s): We analyzed the effect of afatinib and temozolomide (TMZ) combination on GBM cells U87MG and U251 engineered to express wild type (WT) EGFR EGFRvIII or EGFRvIII dead kinase CSCs isolated from U87 and U87EGFRvIII in vitro. The therapeutic utility of the drug combination was investigated on tumor growth and progression using intracranially injected U87EGFRvIII GBM xenografts. Result(s): Afatinib and TMZ combination synergistically inhibited the proliferation clonogenic survival motility invasion and induced senescence of GBM cells compared to monotherapy. Mechanistically afatinib decreased U87EGFRvIII GBM cell proliferation and motility/invasion by inhibiting EGFRvIII/AKT EGFRvIII/JAK2/STAT3 and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) signaling pathways respectively. Interestingly afatinib specifically inhibited EGFRvIII-cMET crosstalk in CSCs resulting in decreased expression of Nanog and Oct3/4 and in combination with TMZ significantly decreased their self-renewal property in vitro. More interestingly afatinib and TMZ combination significantly decreased the xenograft growth and progression compared to single drug alone. Conclusion(s): Our study demonstrated significant inhibition of GBM tumorigenicity CSC maintenance in vitro and delayed tumor growth and progression in vivo by combination of afatinib and TMZ. Our results warrant evaluation of this drug combination in EGFR and EGFRvIII amplified GBM patients.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).,,N ,,10.1186/s13046-019-1264-2,,Is this publication relevent to this project?,
ad8ce2bc-4f32-470f-9283-661b46dbd444,Transcriptional targeting of adenovirally delivered tumor necrosis factor alpha by temozolomide in experimental glioblastoma,2004,Temozolomide is an oral alkylating agent shown to have modest efficacy in the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme. Tumor necrosis factor a (TNF-alpha) is a polypeptide cytokine with synergistic antitumor activity in combination therapy with alkylating agents. We investigated the combined use of Ad.Egr-TNF a replication-defective adenoviral vector encoding the cDNA for TNF-alpha under the control of chemo-inducible elements of the egrl gene promoter and intraperitoneal temozolomide in an intracranial human malignant glioma model. In hind limb U87MG xenografts temozolomide produced a 6.4-fold greater induction of TNF-alpha after infection with Ad.Egr-TNF compared with Ad.Egr-TNF alone at 96 hours (P < 0.02). TNF-alpha and temozolomide combination leads to a synergistic decrease in U87 cell viability at 72 hours compared with either treatment alone (P < 0.001). Median survival for animals treated with Ad.Egr-TNF alone temozolomide alone and Ad.Egr-TNF/temozolomide was 21 28 and 74 days respectively (P < 0.001 by log-rank).

ae85ce54-551a-40ec-a732-2c5e21d6c4a9,STAT3 Inhibition Overcomes Temozolomide Resistance in Glioblastoma by Downregulating MGMT Expression,2012,Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is one of the most aggressive human tumors with a poor prognosis. Current standard treatment includes chemotherapy with the DNA-alkylating agent temozolomide concomitant with surgical resection and/or irradiation. However a number of cases are resistant to temozolomide-induced DNA damage due to elevated expression of the DNA repair enzyme O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT). Here we show that upregulation of both MGMT and STAT3 was accompanied with acquisition of temozolomide resistance in the GBM cell line U87. Inactivation of STAT3 by inhibitor or short hairpin RNA (shRNA) downregulated MGMT expression in GBM cell lines. MGMT upregulation was not observed by the treatment of interleukin (IL)-6 which is a strong activator of STAT3. Contrarily forced expressed MGMT could be downregulated by STAT3 inhibitor which was partially rescued by the proteasome inhibitor MG132 suggesting the STAT3-mediated posttranscriptional regulation of the protein levels of MGMT.

af3dc974-6fbe-464b-8cc1-33fd9873fa3b,Effects of solvent used for fabrication on drug loading and release kinetics of electrosprayed temozolomide-loaded PLGA microparticles for the treatment of glioblastoma,2019,Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common and invasive form of malignant brain tumors and despite advances in surgery radiotherapy and chemotherapy the survival of patients with GBM still remains poor. Temozolomide (TMZ) is the chemotherapy drug that is most commonly given orally after surgical resection of these tumors. In this study the effects of solvents (i.e. dichloromethane and acetonitrile) used for the fabrication of electrosprayed TMZ-loaded poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) on drug loading loading efficiency drug release kinetics surface morphology and particle size were investigated. The results from this study demonstrated that by using a larger volume of a solvent with higher polarity (i.e. acetonitrile) which allows for a higher amount of hydrophilic TMZ to dissolve into the polymer solution higher drug loading could be achieved. However the particles fabricated with high amount of acetonitrile which has a lower vapor pressure had large pores and a smaller diameter which led to an initial burst release and high cumulative release at the end of the study. An optimal combination of the two solvents is needed to result in particles with a good amount of loading and minimal initial burst release. The electrosprayed microparticles were able to illicit a cytotoxic response in U-87 MG glioblastoma cells at a lower concentration of drug compared to the free drug. This work indicated that electrospraying is a promising method for the fabrication of TMZ-loaded PLGA microparticles for the treatment of GBM and solvent composition can be altered to control drug loading and release kinetics.

In the present study the anticancer effects of drug-loaded Fe3O4 magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) by chemo-photothermal therapy on U-87 MG human glioblastoma cells was investigated. Anticancer drug-loaded Fe3O4 MNPs were prepared by loading temozolomide (TMZ) and indocyanine green (ICG) and were characterized by X-ray diffraction UV-vis spectroscopy thermal gravimetric analysis transmission electron microscope as well as drug-loading capacity. Following treatment with near-infrared (NIR) light irradiation the administration of Fe3O4-TMZ-ICG MNPs resulted in the apoptosis of U-87 MG glioblastoma cells through the generation of reactive oxygen species. Western blot analysis and reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction revealed that Fe3O4-TMZ-ICG MNPs with NIR laser irradiation lead to significantly enhanced anticancer effects on U-87 MG glioblastoma cells through the modulation of intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis genes including Bcl-2-associated X protein Bcl-2 cytochrome c caspase-3 Fas associated via death domain and caspase-8. These results suggest that Fe3O4-TMZ-ICG MNPs may be potential candidates when administered as chemo-phototherapy for the treatment of brain cancer.,,Ho ,,10.3892/or.2019.7289,,Is this publication relevent to this project?,

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of HLF alone and in combination with temozolomide (TMZ) a conventional chemotherapeutic on human glioblastoma (GBM) cells. Methods The authors cultured fresh human primary cell lines NMD and FN and the continuous cell line U87MG to evaluate proliferation in the presence of HLF alone at different doses (1 10 and 100 mg/ml and 1 mg/ml) and in combination with TMZ. In in vivo experiments they assessed tumor size reduction in CD1 nude mice carrying an orthotopic GBM xenograft and orally treated with HLF. Results Lactoferrin causes growth inhibition in the NMD and FN primary cell lines and in the U87MG continuous cell line. This inhibition seemed to be modulated by the downregulation of cyclin D1 and D4. Western blot and fluorescenceactivated cell sorting analysis showed inhibition of the cell cycle in G0/G1 and G2 phases. When administered in nude mice HLF (60 mg/kg/day) decreased tumor size about 30% as shown in both histological analyses and high-field brain MRI. Administration of HLF with TMZ enhanced the effect of chemotherapy both in vitro and in vivo. Conclusions This study demonstrated that HLF can inhibit GBM cell growth suggesting that this nontoxic substance may have a role in potentiating the effect of current TMZ treatment of GBM.Copyright © AANS 2015.,,A ,,10.3171/2014.12.JNS14512,,Is this publication relevent to this project?,

However the mechanism of IDH1 mutations on the chemosensitivity of glioma remains unclear. In this study we investigated the role and the potential mechanism of Nrf2 in IDH1 R132H-mediated drug resistance. Method(s): Wild type IDH1 (R132H-WT) and mutant IDH1 (R132H) plasmids were constructed. Stable U87 cells and U251 cells overexpressing IDH1 were generated. Phenotypic differences between IDH1-WT and IDH1 R132H overexpressing cells were evaluated using MTT cell colony formation assay scratch test assay and flow cytometry. Expression of IDH1 and its associated targets nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) NAD(P)H quinine oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) multidrug resistant protein 1 (MRP1) and p53 were analyzed. Result(s): The IDH1 R132H overexpressing cells were more sensitive to temozolomide than WT and the control and Nrf2 was significantly decreased in IDH1 R132H overexpressing cells. We found that knocking down Nrf2 could decrease resistance to temozolomide. The nuclear translocation of Nrf2 in IDH1 R132H overexpressing cells was lower than the WT and the control groups after temozolomide treatment. When compared with WT cells NQO1 expression was reduced in IDH1 R132H cells especially after temozolomide treatment. P53 was involved in the resistance mechanism of temozolomide mediated by Nrf2 and NQO1. Conclusion(s): Nrf2 played an important role in IDH1 R132H-mediated drug resistance.

We examined the U87 U251 and U373 malignant cell lines as in vitro models to determine the impact of cellular cross-talk on their phenotypic alterations in co-cultures. These cells were also studied at the transcriptome level to define the mechanisms of their observed mutually affected genomic stability proliferation invasion and resistance to temozolomide. This is the first direct demonstration of the neural and mesenchymal molecular fingerprints of U87 and U373 cells respectively. U87-cell conditioned medium lowered the genomic stability of U373 (U251) cells without affecting cell proliferation. In contrast upon exposure of U87 cells to U373 (U251) conditioned medium U87 cells showed increased genomic stability decreased proliferation rates and increased invasion due to a plethora of produced cytokines identified in the co-culture media. This cross talk altered the expression 264 genes in U87 cells that are associated with proliferation inflammation migration and adhesion and 221 genes in U373 cells that are associated with apoptosis the cell cycle cell differentiation and migration. Indirect and direct co-culturing of U87 and U373 cells showed mutually opposite effects on temozolomide resistance. In conclusion definition of transcriptional alterations of distinct glioblastoma cells upon co-culturing provides better understanding of the mechanisms of glioblastoma heterogeneity which will provide the basis for more informed glioma treatment in the future.,,T ,,10.18632/oncotarget.5701,,Is this publication relevent to this project?,

Despite optimal treatment and evolving standard of care the median survival of patients diagnosed with GBM is only 12-15 months. In this study we combined progesterone (PROG) and temozolomide (TMZ) a standard chemotherapeutic agent for human GBM to test whether PROG enhances the antitumor effects of TMZ and reduces its side effects. Two WHO grade IV human GBM cells lines (U87MG and U118MG) and primary human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs) were repeatedly exposed to PROG and TMZ either alone or in combination for 3 and 6 days. Cell death was measured by MTT reduction assay. PROG and TMZ individually induced tumor cell death in a dose-dependent manner. PROG at high doses produced more cell death than TMZ alone. When combined PROG enhanced the cell death-inducing effect of TMZ. In HDFs PROG did not reduce viability even at the same high cytotoxic doses but TMZ did so in a dose-dependent manner. In combination PROG reduced TMZ toxicity in HDFs. PROG alone and in combination with TMZ suppressed the EGFR/PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway and MGMT expression in U87MG cells thus suppressing cell proliferation. PROG and TMZ individually reduced cell migration in U87MG cells but did so more effectively in combination.

bbd28e5c-8abb-4aa9-8a72-46f6224b785a,Blocking LDHA glycolytic pathway sensitizes glioblastoma cells to radiation and temozolomide,2017,Purpose Up-regulation of lactate dehydrogenase LDHA is a frequent event in human malignancies and relate to poor postoperative outcome. In the current study we examined the hypothesis that LDHA and anaerobic glycolysis may contribute to the resistance of glioblastoma to radiotherapy and to temozolomide. Methods and materials The expression of LDH5 isoenzyme (fully encoded by the LDHA gene) was assessed in human glioblastoma tissues. Experimental in vitro studies involved the T98 and U87 glioblastoma cell lines. Their sensitivity to radiotherapy and to temozolomide following silencing of LDHA gene or following exposure to the LDHA chemical inhibitor 'oxamate' and to the glycolysis inhibitor '2-deoxy-D-glucose' (2DG) was studied. Results Glioblastoma tissues showed strong cytoplasmic and nuclear LDH5 expression in 0-90% (median 20%) of the neoplastic cells. T98 and U87 cell lines showed that blocking glycolysis either with LDHA gene silencing or exposure to oxamate (30 mM) and blockage of glycolysis with 2DG (500 muM) results in enhanced radiation sensitivity an effect that was more robust in the T98 radioresistant cell line. Furthermore all three glycolysis targeting methods significantly sensitized both cell lines to Temozolomide. Conclusions The current study provides evidence that a large subgroup of human glioblastomas are highly glycolytic and that inhibitors of glycolysis like LDHA targeting agents may prove of therapeutic importance by enhancing the efficacy of radiotherapy and temozolomide against this lethal disease.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.,,A ,,10.1016/j.bbrc.2017.07.138,,Is this publication relevent to this project?,

Nonetheless TMZ-induced side effects and drug resistance remain challenges. Our previous study showed the suppressive effects of honokiol on growth of gliomas. Purpose: This study was further aimed to evaluate if honokiol could enhance TMZ-induced insults toward malignant glioma cells and its possible mechanisms. Methods: Human U87 MG glioma cells were exposed to TMZ honokiol and a combination of TMZ and honokiol. Cell survival apoptosis necrosis and proliferation were successively assayed. Fluorometric substrate assays were conducted to determine activities of caspase-3 -6 -8 and -9. Levels of Fas ligand Bax and cytochrome c were immunodetected. Translocation of Bax to mitochondria were examined using confocal microscopy. Mitochondrial function was evaluated by assaying the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) reactive oxygen species (ROS) and complex I enzyme activity. Caspase-6 activity was suppressed using specific peptide inhibitors. The honokiol-induced effects were further confirmed using human U373 MG and murine GL261 cells. Results: Exposure of human U87 MG glioma cells to honokiol significantly increased TMZ-induced DNA fragmentation and cell apoptosis. Interestingly honokiol enhanced intrinsic caspase-9 activity without affecting extrinsic Fas ligand levels and caspase-8 activity. Sequentially TMZ-induced changes in Bax translocation the MMP mitochondrial complex I enzyme activity intracellular ROS levels and cytochrome c release were enhanced by honokiol. Consequently honokiol amplified TMZ-induced activation of caspases-3 and -6 in human U87 MG cells. Fascinatingly suppressing caspase-6 activity concurrently decreased honokiol-induced DNA fragmentation and cell apoptosis. The honokiol-involved improvement in TMZ-induced intrinsic apoptosis was also confirmed in human U373 MG and murine GL261 glioma cells. Conclusions: This study showed that honokiol can enhance TMZ-induced apoptotic insults to glioma cells via an intrinsic mitochondrion-dependent mechanism.

be803dbb-704d-415f-b680-6501962528b2,YKL-40 downregulation is a key factor to overcome temozolomide resistance in a glioblastoma cell line,2014,The frequent recurrence of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) after standard treatment with temozolomide (TMZ) is a crucial issue to be solved in the clinical field. O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) is considered one of the major mechanisms involved in TMZ resistance. However some important mechanisms for TMZ resistance other than MGMT have recently been identified. In the present study we established a TMZ-resistant (TMZ-R) U87 glioblastoma cell line in vitro and in vivo and investigated novel targeting molecules other than MGMT in those cells. The TMZ-R U87 glioblastoma cell line was established in vitro and in vivo. TMZ-R U87 cells showed a more invasive activity and a shorter survival time in vivo. Gene expression analysis using DNA microarray and quantitative PCR (qPCR) demonstrated that YKL-40 MAGEC1 and MGMT mRNA expression was upregulated 100- 83- and 6-fold respectively in the TMZ-R U87 cell line. Western blot analysis and qPCR demonstrated that STAT3 phosphorylation STAT3 target genes and stem cell and mesenchymal marker genes were upregulated to a greater extent in the TMZ-resistant cell line. Notably short hairpin (sh)RNA-based inhibition against the YKL-40 gene resulted in moderate growth inhibition in the resistant cells in vitro and in vivo. Additionally YKL-40 gene inhibition exhibited significant suppression of the invasive activity and particularly partially restored the sensitivity to TMZ. Therefore YKL-40 may be a novel key molecule in addition to MGMT that is responsible for TMZ resistance in glioblastoma cell lines and could be a new target to overcome TMZ resistance in recurrent glioblastomas in the future.,,Ken ,,10.3892/or.2014.3195,,Is this publication relevent to this project?,
beca8ec4-ca41-409c-8391-949a34ba63bc,MiR-21 protected human glioblastoma U87MG cells from chemotherapeutic drug temozolomide induced apoptosis by decreasing Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and caspase-3 activity,2010,MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNA molecules that regulate protein expression by cleaving or repressing the translation of target mRNAs. In mammal animals their function mainly represses the target mRNAs transcripts via imperfectly complementary to the 3'UTR of target mRNAs. Several miRNAs have been recently reported to be involved in modulation of glioma development especially some up-regulated miRNAs such as microRNA-21 (miR-21) which has been found to function as an oncogene in cultured glioblastoma multiforme cells. Temozolomide (TMZ) an alkylating agent is a promising chemotherapeutic agent for treating glioblastoma. However resistance develops quickly and with high frequency. To explore the mechanism of resistance we found that miR-21 could protect human glioblastoma U87MG cells from TMZ induced apoptosis. Our studies showed that TMZ markedly enhanced apoptosis in U87MG cells compared with untreated cells (P < 0.05). However over-express miR-21 in U87MG cells could significantly reduce TMZ-induced apoptosis (P < 0.05). Pro-apoptotic Bax and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins are known to regulate the apoptosis of glioma cells. Bcl-2 resistance to induction of apoptosis constitutes one major obstacle to chemotherapy in many cancer cells. Bax is shown to correlate with an increased survival of glioblastoma multiforme patients. Further research demonstrated that the mechanism was associated with a shift in Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and change in caspase-3 activity. Compared to control cells cells treated with TMZ showed a significant increase in the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and caspase-3 activity (P < 0.01). However such effect was partly prevented by treatment of cells with miR-21 overexpression before which appeared to downregulate the Bax expression upregulate the Bcl-2 expression and decrease caspase-3 activity. Taken together these results suggested that over-express miR-21 could inhibit TMZ-induced apoptosis in U87MG cells at least in part by decreasing Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and caspase-3 activity which highlighted the possibility of miR-21 overexpression in the clinical resistance to chemotherapeutic therapy of TMZ. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

c785aafc-b3c4-4998-a590-1f46247645ed,The Pan-Bcl-2 Inhibitor (-)-Gossypol Triggers Autophagic Cell Death in Malignant Glioma,2010,Antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members suppress both apoptosis and autophagy and are of major importance for therapy resistance of malignant gliomas. To target these molecules we used BH3 mimetics and analyzed the molecular mechanisms of cell death induced thereby. Glioma cells displayed only limited sensitivity to single-agent treatment with the BH3 mimetics HA14-1 BH3I-2' and ABT-737 whereas the pan-Bcl-2 inhibitor (-)-gossypol efficiently induced cell death. Furthermore (-)-gossypol potentiated cell death induced by temozolomide (TMZ) in MGMT (O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase)-negative U343 cells and to a lesser extent in MGMT-expressing U87 cells. (-)-Gossypol triggered translocation of light chain 3 to autopha-gosomes and lysosomes and cytochrome c release but cell death occurred in the absence of lysosomal damage and effector caspase activation. Lentiviral knockdown of Beclin1 and Atg5 in U87 U343 and MZ-54 cells strongly diminished the extent of cell death induced by (-)-gossypol and combined treatment with TMZ indicating that autophagy contributed to this type of cell death. In contrast stable knockdown of the endogenous autophagy inhibitor mammalian target of rapamycin increased autophagic cell death. Our data suggest that pan-Bcl-2 inhibitors are promising drugs that induce caspase-independent autophagic cell death in apoptosis-resistant malignant glioma cells and augment the action of TMZ. Furthermore they indicate that efficient killing of glioma cells requires neutralization of Mcl-1. Mol Cancer Res,,Donat ,,NA,,Is this publication relevent to this project?,
c7ca4ee1-0698-4126-9b6a-1f7cea87aca9,MiR-144 overexpression as a promising therapeutic strategy to overcome glioblastoma cell invasiveness and resistance to chemotherapy,2019,Glioblastoma (GB) is the most aggressive and common form of primary brain tumor characterized by fast proliferation high invasion and resistance to current standard treatment. The average survival rate post-diagnosis is only of 14.6 months despite the aggressive standard post-surgery treatment approaches of radiotherapy concomitant with chemotherapy with temozolomide. Altered cell metabolism has been identified as an emerging cancer hallmark including in GB thus offering a new target for cancer therapies. On the other hand abnormal expression levels of miRNAs key regulators of multiple molecular pathways have been correlated with pathological manifestations of cancer such as chemoresistance proliferation and resistance to apoptosis. In this work we hypothesized that gene therapy based on modulation of a miRNA with aberrant expression in GB and predicted to target crucial metabolic enzymes might impair tumor cell metabolism. We found that the increase of miR-144 levels shown to be downregulated in U87 and DBTRG human GB cell lines as well as in GB tumor samples promoted the downregulation of mRNA of enzymes involved in bioenergetic pathways with consequent alterations in cell metabolism impairment of migratory capacity and sensitization of DBTRG cells to a chemotherapeutic drug the dichloroacetate (DCA). Taken together our findings provide evidence that the miR-144 plus DCA combined therapy holds promise to overcome GB-acquired chemoresistance therefore deserving to be explored toward its potential application as a complementary therapeutic approach to the current treatment options for this type of brain tumor.,,S ,,10.1093/hmg/ddz099,,Is this publication relevent to this project?,

This enzyme is under post-translational control by a multisubunit proteolytic cellular machinery the 26S proteasome. Inhibition of the proteasome by bortezomib (BZ) a boronic acid dipeptide already in clinical use for the treatment of myeloma has been demonstrated to induce growth arrest and apoptosis in GBM cells. In this study we investigated the effect of sequential treatment with BZ and TMZ on cell proliferation-viability and apoptosis of the human T98G and U87 GBM cell lines. We also tested for an effect of treatment on MGMT expression and important upstream regulators of the latter including nuclear factor kappa B (NF kappa B) p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) p53 signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha). The sequence of drug administration for maximal cytotoxicity favored BZ prior to TMZ in T98G cells while the opposite was the case for U87 cells. Maximal efficacy was associated with downregulation of MGMT reduced I kappa B alpha-mediated proteasome-dependent nuclear accumulation of NF kappa B attenuation of p44/42 MAPK AKT and STAT3 activation and stabilization of p53 and inactive HIF-1 alpha. Collectively these results suggest that proteasome inhibition by BZ overcomes MGMT-mediated GBM chemoresistance with scheduling of administration being critical for obtaining the maximal tumoricidal effect of combination with TMZ.,,N ,,10.1007/s10637-013-9968-1,,Is this publication relevent to this project?,

Despite concerted efforts to improve therapies their prognosis remains very poor. Isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) mutations have been discovered frequently in glioma patients and are strongly correlated with improved survival. However the effect of IDH1 mutations on the chemosensitivity of gliomas remains unclear. In this study we generated clonal U87 and U251 glioma cell lines overexpressing the R132H mutant protein (IDH1-R132H). Compared with control cells and cells overexpressing IDH wild type (IDH1-WT) both types of IDH1-R132H cells were more sensitive to temozolomide (TMZ) and cis-diamminedichloroplatinum (CDDP) in a time- and dose-dependent manner. The IDH1-R132H-induced higher chemosensitivity was associated with nicotine adenine disphosphonucleotide (NADPH) glutathione (GSH) depletion and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Accordingly this IDH1-R132H-induced growth inhibition was effectively abrogated by GSH in vitro and in vivo. Our study provides direct evidence that the improved survival in patients with IDH1-R132H tumors may partly result from the effects of the IDH1-R132H protein on chemosensitivity. The primary cellular events associated with improved survival are the GSH depletion and increased ROS generation.,,Jian ,,10.1007/s13277-014-2644-z,,Is this publication relevent to this project?,

The late autophagy inhibitor chloroquine (CQ) inhibits glioblastoma tumors in a p53-independent and p53-dependent manner. We addressed a possible beneficial effect of combination treatment with TMZ and CQ by examining the molecular and cellular mechanism of co-treatment. Combination treatment of U87 cell (wild type p53) with TMZ and CQ synergistically reduced cell proliferation and enhanced apoptosis with increased sub-G(1) hypodiploid cells and caspase activation. This effect was abolished by a pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK. TMZ induced autophagy and the addition of CQ further increased autophagic vacuoles. Inhibition of early stages of autophagy by Beclin 1 knockdown and 3-methyladenine pretreatment prevented the enhanced effect of the combination treatment. The combination treatment also upregulated p53 and phospho-p53 levels whereas p53 knockdown or overexpression of mutant p53 abolished the combination effect. In contrast combination therapy had no enhanced effect on U373 cell (mutant p53) proliferation and apoptosis within 3 d although TMZ induced autophagy and co-treatment with CQ increased autophagic vacuole accumulation. However long term combination treatment for 9-10 d effectively decreased clonal and cellular growth with increased G(2)-M arrest. This effect was also abolished by Beclin 1 knockdown. Our data support the beneficial effect of combination treatment with TMZ and CQ in glioma via differential autophagy-associated mechanisms depending on p53 status. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

cab23e47-f0ab-45fb-bd67-cf51bd0fb068,Sirtuin 1 knockdown inhibits glioma cell proliferation and potentiates temozolomide toxicity via facilitation of reactive oxygen species generation,2019,Malignant glioma is one of the most common types of primary malignancies in the human central nervous system. Temozolomide (TMZ) is the most commonly used drug in clinical therapy of glioma; however chemoresistance makes glioma difficult to cure and relapse likely. Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) serves important roles in cell proliferation differentiation and metabolism but the role of SIRT1 in human glioma remains largely unexplored. In the present study SIRT1 expression was assessed in human glioma tissues and cells. RNA interference and SIRT1 inhibitor were used to determine the effect of SIRT1 on glioma growth inhibition and glioma cell chemoresistance in vitro and in vivo. The levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in glioma cells were detected with the dihydroethidium probe following SIRT1 inhibition. The results demonstrated that SIRT1 was overexpressed in glioma tissues and cells and patients with higher SIRT1 expression exhibited poorer prognosis. SIRT1 inhibition inhibited the proliferation of U87 and U251 cells. In addition SIRT1 knockdown and SIRT1 inhibitor could significantly sensitize glioma cells to TMZ treatment in vitro and in vivo. The expression of Ki67 and p53 was demonstrated to be regulated by SIRT1. Finally SIRT1 could regulate intracellular ROS generation in TMZ. In summary SIRT1 was essential for glioma tumorigenesis and glioma cell chemoresistance. SIRT1 inhibition increased the sensitivity of glioma cells for TMZ via the facilitation of intracellular ROS generation which suggested that SIRT1 may serve as a target for clinical therapy of glioma.,,Yimin ,,10.3892/ol.2019.10235,,Is this publication relevent to this project?,
cde3f9f6-7d1b-4135-88f6-be634050305e,Anti-epidermal growth factor receptor siRNA carried by chitosan-transacylated lipid nanocapsules increases sensitivity of glioblastoma cells to temozolomide,2014,Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a crucial protein that plays an important role in the maintenance and development of glioblastomas. The silencing or knockdown of EGFR is possible by administering a small interfering ribonucleic acid (siRNA). Lipid nanocapsules (LNCs) covered by chitosan were developed in our laboratory by a transacylation process. The resulting nanocapsules have a positive zeta potential that enables electrostatic interactions with the negatively-charged siRNA. Prior to transfection the cytotoxicity of the nanocapsules by (3-(45-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium) (MTS) test was performed on the U87MG cell line to determine non-toxic levels of the LNCs to avoid cell mortality. Treatment of the U87MG cells with the chitosan-transacylated LNCs/anti-EGFR siRNA complex resulted in a reduction of EGFR expression by 51.95% ± 6.03% (P ≤ 0.05) after 96 hours of incubation. It also increased the cellular sensitivity to temozolomide in comparison to untreated cells with siRNA. The largest increase in mortality was 62.55% ± 3.55% (P<0.05). This successful knockdown provides proof for the concept of surface grafting of siRNA onto LNCs to modify cell sensitivity to temozolomide. The method could be implemented in future clinical models regarding the experimental treatment of glioblastoma cancer.,,Frederic ,,10.2147/IJN.S59134,,Is this publication relevent to this project?,

The nitric oxide (NO) donor PABA/NO (O 2-{24-dinitro-5-[4-(N-methylamino)benzoyloxy]phenyl} 1-(NN-dimethylamino)diazen-1-ium-12-diolate) generates NO upon selective enzymatic activation by GST-pi-inducing selective biological effects in tumors. Tumor cell killing and chemosensitization were observed in a variety of tumors after exposure to GST-activated NO donor drugs. In our project cytotoxic and chemosensitizing effects of PABA/NO in combination with carboplatin (CPT) and temozolomide (TMZ) were studied in human U87 glioma cells in vitro and in vivo. U87 glioma cells were exposed to PABA/NO alone or in combination with CPT or TMZ for 24 hr. Cell viability was assessed by 3-(45-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay after 24-hr incubation and 48 hr after drug removal. The antiproliferative effect of PABA/NO was assessed in an intracranial U87 glioma nude rat model comparing subcutaneous administration and intratumoral delivery by convection-enhanced delivery. PABA/NO monotherapy showed a strong dose-dependent growth-inhibitory effect in U87 glioma cells in vitro and a strong synergistic effect was observed after concomitant treatment with TMZ but not with CPT. Systemic and intratumoral PABA/NO administration significantly reduced cell proliferation but this did not result in prolonged survival in nude rats with intracranial U87 gliomas. PABA/NO has potent antiproliferative effects sensitizes U87 glioma cells to TMZ in vitro and shows some in vivo efficacy. Further studies are still required to consolidate the role of NO donor therapy in glioma treatment. Copyright © 2011 UICC.,,A ,,10.1002/ijc.26106,,Is this publication relevent to this project?,

Efficient delivery of therapeutic agents to the cells and tissues is a difficult challenge. Co-delivery of anticancer drugs into the cancer cells or tissues by multifunctional nanocarriers may provide a new paradigm in cancer treatment. OBJECTIVE: In this study solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) and nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) were constructed for co-delivery of vincristine (VCR) and temozolomide (TMZ) to develop the synergetic therapeutic action of the two drugs. The antitumor effects of these two systems were compared to provide a better choice for gliomatosis cerebri treatment. METHODS: VCR- and TMZ-loaded SLNs (VT-SLNs) and NLCs (VT-NLCs) were formulated. Their particle size zeta potential drug encapsulation efficiency (EE) and drug loading capacity were evaluated. The single TMZ-loaded SLNs and NLCs were also prepared as contrast. Anti-tumor efficacies of the two kinds of carriers were evaluated on U87 malignant glioma cells and mice bearing malignant glioma model. RESULTS: Significantly better glioma inhibition was observed on NLCs formulations than SLNs and dual drugs displayed the highest antitumor efficacy in vivo and in vitro than all the other formulations used. CONCLUSION: VT-NLCs can deliver VCR and TMZ into U87MG cells more efficiently and inhibition efficacy is higher than VT-SLNs. This dual drugs-loaded NLCs could be an outstanding drug delivery system to achieve excellent therapeutic efficiency for the treatment of malignant gliomatosis cerebri.,,Xingen ,,10.3109/10717544.2015.1058434,,Is this publication relevent to this project?,

Recently long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been implicated in chemotherapy resistance in various cancers. In this study we found that the level of the lncRNA RP11-838N2.4 was lower in TMZ-resistant GBM cells (U87TR U251TR) compared to the parental non-resistant GBM cells (U87 U251). In GBM patients the decreased level of lncRNA RP11-838N2.4 correlated with higher risk of GBM relapse as well as shorter postoperative survival times. We further found that lncRNA RP11-838N2.4 could enhances the cytotoxic effects of temozolomide to GBM cells both in vivo and in vitro. Moreover lncRNA RP11-838N2.4 acts as an endogenous sponge suppressing the function of miR-10a through conserved sequences and increasing the expression of EphA8 that enhanced the rate of cell apoptosis thereby intensified sensitivity of GBM cells to TMZ. Additionally lncRNA RP11-838N2.4 inhibited the activity of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) independent of miR-10a.

However the molecular mechanisms by which TMZ induces autophagy are largely unknown. In the current study the ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) inhibitor KU-55933 adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) inhibitor compound C and U87MG and U251 cell lines were employed to investigate the molecular mechanisms of TMZ-induced autophagy in glioma and to evaluate the effects of autophagy inhibition on TMZ cytotoxicity. KU-55933 and compound C were observed to inhibit the activation of autophagy-initiating kinase ULK1 and result in a significant decrease of autophagy as indicated by depressed LC3B cleavage and acidic vesicular organelle formation. The activation of AMPK-ULK1 was ATM dependent. Autophagy inhibition via the AMPK inhibitor compound C augmented TMZ cytotoxicity as observed by depressed cell viability increased gamma H2AX-marked double-strand breaks (DSBs) and elevated numbers of apoptotic glioma cells. In conclusion TMZ induced autophagy via ATM-AMPK-ULK1 pathways. TMZ chemoresistance may therefore be overwhelmed by targeting AMPK particularly for the treatment of O-6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase-negative gliomas.,,Weimin ,,10.3892/mmr.2014.2151,,Is this publication relevent to this project?,

Recent data has suggested a profound role for microRNAs (miRs) in cancer progression. The present study demonstrated via quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis that miR-203 expression was markedly lower in highly invasive U87MG glioma cells and glioma tissues. Wound healing and Transwell assays demonstrated that restoration of miR-203 expression inhibited U87MG cell migration and invasion. Restoration of miR-203 expression additionally sensitized the cells to temozolomide (TMZ) as determined by MTS assay. By contrast miR-203 inhibition in A172 cells exerted opposite effects. Bioinformatic analysis combined with experimental analysis revealed that miR-203 directly targeted E2F3 via the conserved miR-203 target site within the E2F3 3-untranslational region. E2F3 knockdown with specific small hairpin RNA also inhibited U87MG cell migration and invasion and sensitized them to TMZ. Importantly miR-203 and E2F3 showed inverse expression patterns in invasive glioma tissues as demonstrated by qPCR and luciferase assay. These results suggested that miR-203 may function as a tumor suppressor in glioma progression and that the miR-203/E2F3 axis may be a novel candidate in the development of rational therapeutic strategies for glioma.,,Lei ,,10.3892/mmr.2014.3101,,Is this publication relevent to this project?,

New therapies are currently in development to tackle treatment limitations such as chemotherapy resistance. One mechanism of resistance may be the stress granules (SG) assembly a stress-related cellular response that allows cells to recruit and protect mRNAs during stress. SG are composed of various proteins being G3BP1 a core element that enucleates and results in SG assembly. Here we aimed to evaluate the effects of inhibiting the G3PB1 expression in the chemotherapeutical-induced cell death of the U87 glioblastoma cell line. Materials and Methods G3BP1 mRNA and protein expression were modulated with short-interference RNA (siRNA). The viability of U87 cells after Bortezomib (BZM) a proteasome inhibitor and Temozolomide (TMZ) an alkylating agent was assessed by MTT assay. Apoptosis was evaluated by staining cells with Annexin-V/7-AAD and analyzing by flow cytometry. Caspase-3 activation was evaluated by immunoblotting. The chorioallantoic membrane in vivo assay was used to evaluate angiogenesis. Results When G3BP1 was knocked-down the SG assembly was reduced and the BZM-treated cells but not TMZ-treated cells had a significant increase in the apoptotic response. Corroborating this data we observed increased Caspase-3 activation in the BZM-treated and G3BP1-knocked-down cells when compared to vehicle-treated and scramble-transfected cells. Worth mentioning the conditioned culture medium of G3BP1-knocked-down BZM-treated cells inhibited angiogenesis when compared to controls. Conclusion Our data suggest G3BP1 knockdown diminishes SG formation and stimulates BZM-induced apoptosis of U87 cells in vitro in addition to inhibiting glioblastoma-induced angiogenesis in vivo.,,F.Silva R.

However a considerable number of glioblastoma (GBM) cases are refractory to TMZ. Previous studies have revealed that the PI3K/Akt pathway is activated in an ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3 related-dependent manner in response to TMZ. Thus we hypothesized that PI3K inhibitors may act as antitumor agents against gliomas and potentiate the cytotoxicity of TMZ. The cytotoxicity of a PI3K inhibitor LY294002 was examined both alone and in combination with TMZ in human glioma cell lines. Proliferation of tumor cells treated with LY294002 in combination with TMZ was significantly suppressed compared to treatment with either drug used alone. The combination treatment induced a higher apoptosis rate while reducing the invasive capability of U87 cells. The apoptosis-associated proteins cleaved-caspase-3 and Bax were more significantly up-regulated by the combined treatment than by TMZ used alone. In addition p-Akt and Bcl-2 which can promote TMZ resistance were markedly decreased by LY294002. These findings suggest that LY294002 enhances the cytotoxicity of TMZ by down-regulation of the PI3K/Akt pathway.,,Chunsheng ,,10.3892/mmr.2011.674,,Is this publication relevent to this project?,

However its poor stability and unfavorable pharmacokinetic profile limit its clinical efficacy. There is an unmet need to tailor the therapeutic window of TMZ either through complex derivatization or by utilizing pharmaceutical excipients. To enhance stability and aqueous solubility we encapsulated TMZ in a p-sulphonatocalix[4]arene (Calix) nanocapsule and used (1)H-NMR LC-MS and UV-Vis spectroscopy to chart the stability of this novel TMZ@Calix complex according to FDA and European Medicines Agency guidelines. LC-MS/MS plasma stability assays were conducted in mice to further explore the stability profile of TMZ@Calix in vivo The therapeutic efficacy of TMZ@Calix was compared with that of unbound TMZ in GBM cell lines and patient-derived primary cells with known O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) expression status and in vivo in an intracranial U87 xenograft mouse model. Encapsulation significantly enhanced the stability of TMZ in all conditions tested. TMZ@Calix was more potent than native TMZ at inhibiting the growth of established GBM cell lines and patient-derived primary lines expressing MGMT and highly resistant to TMZ. In vivo native TMZ was rapidly degraded in mouse plasma whereas the stability of TMZ@Calix was enhanced threefold with increased therapeutic efficacy in an orthotopic model. In the absence of new effective therapies this novel formulation is of clinical importance serving as an inexpensive and highly efficient treatment that could be made readily available to patients with GBM and warrants further preclinical and clinical evaluation.,,Nelofer ,,10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-18-1250,,Is this publication relevent to this project?,
e6d83bb1-39f8-4191-859c-0aa2b94660d1,Effect of temozolomide on the viability of musculoskeletal sarcoma cells,2015,Musculoskeletal sarcomas (MSS) are a heterogeneous group of malignancies with relatively high mortality rates. The prognosis for patients with MSS is poor with few drugs inducing measurable activity. Alkylating agents namely ifosfamide and dacarbazine which act nonspecifically on proliferating cells are the typical therapy prescribed for advanced MSS. A novel alkylating agent temozolomide (TMZ) has several advantages over existing alkylating agents. TMZ induces the formation of O-6-methylguanine in DNA thereby inducing mismatches during DNA replication and the subsequent activation of apoptotic pathways. However due to conflicting data in the literature the mechanism of TMZ action has remained elusive. Therefore the present study aimed to evaluate apoptosis in MSS cells treated with TMZ and to evaluate the correlation between TMZ action and survival pathways including the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. Cell proliferation was evaluated by performing an XTT (sodium 3'-[1-(phenylaminocarbony1)-34-tetrazolium] -bis (4-methoxy-6-nitro) benzene sulfonic acid hydrate) assay. Apoptotic morphological changes for example chromatin condensation were evaluated by fluorescence confocal microscopy. The expression of the apoptosis-associated proteins caspase-3 poly adenosine diphosphate ribose polymerase (PARP) Akt and ERK1/2 was determined by western blotting. The results of the present study indicated that in certain MSS cells the IC50 value was lower than that in TMZ-sensitive U-87 MG cells. Furthermore TMZ treatment was associated with apoptotic morphological changes and the expression levels of pro-apoptotic cleaved caspase-3 and PARP were also increased in TMZ-treated MSS cells. In addition the result indicated that PI3K/Akt and ERK1/2 MAPK were constitutively phosphorylated in MSS cells and phosphorylation of PI3K/Akt was suppressed in certain cells and maintained in other cells by TMZ. These observations emphasized the plasticity of MSS cells and suggested that this plasticity may contribute to the variance in cell sensitivity to TMZ and TMZ-resistance in MSS.,,Naoto ,,10.3892/ol.2015.3506,,Is this publication relevent to this project?,

Paris polyphyllins are monomers extracted from rhizome of Paris polyphylla var. yunnanensis. Here we first reported that polyphyllin VII (PP7) exhibited cytotoxic effect on glioma cells. PP7 significantly suppressed the viability and induced cell death of U87-MG and U251 cells after 24 h with the IC50 values 4.24 ± 0.87 μM and 2.17 ± 0.14 μM respectively. Both apoptotic and autophagic processes were involved in the cytotoxic effect of PP7 as PP7 activated the Bcl2/Bax pathway and the inhibition of autophagy partly rescued the toxicity of PP7 in glioma cells. In addition an inhibition of AKT/mTORC1 activity was found after PP7 administration and it seemed that the overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was responsible for this effect. Namely the removal of ROS by NAC treatment mitigated PP7-induced cell death autophagy and its effect on the AKT/mTORC1 signaling. Additionally a combination assay of PP7 with temozolomide (TMZ) the most used chemotherapy for glioma patients was performed resulting in synergism while PP7 reduced TMZ resistance through inhibition of MGMT expression. Thus our study reports PP7 as a potential agent for glioma treatment and reveals its underlying mechanisms of action.,,Chao ,,10.1155/2019/1805635,,Is this publication relevent to this project?,

We previously hypothesised that the neuroleptic olanzapine may enhance antineoplastic effects of temozolomide the standard chemotherapeutic agent used in this disease. This study tested this hypothesis. The anti-proliferative effect of olanzapine was examined by MTT assays and cell count analysis. Soft-agar assays were performed to examine colony-forming ability. In addition the inhibitory effect of olanzapine on the migratory capacity of U87MG and A172 cells was analyzed by Transwell (R) assays. Moreover staining for annexin V/propidium iodide or carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester was performed prior to flow cytometric analysis in order to better understand the subjacent cellular mechanism. Our initial hypothesis that olanzapine may enhance temozolomide's anti-tumor activity could be confirmed in U87MG and A172 glioblastoma cell lines. Moreover treatment with olanzapine alone resulted in a marked anti-proliferative effect on U87MG A172 and two glioma stem-like cells with IC50 values ranging from 25 to 79.9 mu M. In U87MG cells anchorage-independent growth was dose-dependently inhibited. In A172 cells migration was also shown to be inhibited in a dose-dependent manner. In addition olanzapine was shown to exert a cell line-dependent pleomorphism with respect to the induction of apoptosis necrosis and/or cytostasis. Our data show that the neuroleptic olanzapine enhances the anti-tumor activity of temozolomide against glioblastoma cell lines. Moreover this is the first study to show that olanzapine provides on its own anticancer activity in glioblastoma and thus may have potential for repurposing.,,Marc-Eric ,,10.1007/s11060-014-1688-7,,Is this publication relevent to this project?,
ed479714-5bfd-4763-91f0-3fe2fa077ab0,MIM1 the Mcl-1 - specific BH3 mimetic induces apoptosis in human U87MG glioblastoma cells,2018,Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common and high aggressive malignant brain tumor. Despite evolving oncology treatment and novel chemotherapeutic agents the median survival of patients diagnosed with GBM is only 12-15 months. This grim fact highlights necessity to identify new drugs that could improve the effectiveness of GBM patients treatment. MIM1 is a specific low molecular Mcl-1 protein inhibitor able to induce Mcl-1-dependent cancer cells death. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of MIM1 as well as MIM1 and temozolomide (TMZ) mixture on cell viability apoptosis and cell cycle progression in human U87MG glioblastoma cells. Cell viability was performed by the WST-1 assay. Mitochondrial membrane potential Annexin V assay DNA fragmentation and cell cycle distribution were determined by fluorescence image cytometer NucleoCounter NC-3000. The obtained results show that MIM1 and MIM1/TMZ mixture decrease glioblastoma cells viability in a dose- and time- dependent manner. Moreover the exposure of U87MG cells to MIM1 and MIM1/TMZ mixture causes mitochondrial dysfunction as well as DNA fragmentation and cell cycle arrest at G(2)/M phase. This study provides for the first time convincing evidence that BH3 mimetic MIM1 which inhibits Mcl-1 antiapoptotic protein may be an efficacious molecule able to induction of apoptosis and sensitize GBM cells to alkylating agents.,,Ewa ,,10.1016/j.tiv.2018.08.007,,Is this publication relevent to this project?,
ed58d823-4327-44d5-ab6e-5ffcd5ddc99c,Combination of caspase transfer using the human telomerase reverse transcriptase promoter and conventional therapies for malignant glioma cells,2004,Recently we have reported the therapeutic efficacy of delivering initiator caspase (caspase-8) or executioner active caspase (rev-caspase-6) to telomerase-positive malignant glioma cells using the human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) gene promoter system (hTERT/caspase-8 or hTERT/rev-caspase-6). In the present study we investigated if conventional treatments for malignant gliomas augment the efficacy of the hTERT/caspase therapy. First we demonstrated that hTERT/rev-caspase-6 exhibited a greater ability to induce apoptosis in malignant glioma U87-MG and U373-MG cells than hTERT/caspase-8. Next as conventional treatments to combine with hTERT/rev-caspase-6 apoptosis-inducing agents [cisplatin (CDDP) paclitaxel (PTX) and BCNU] and non-apoptosis-inducing therapies [temozolomide (TMZ) and gamma-irradiation (IR)] were used. Combination of hTERT/rev-caspase-6 gene therapy with PTX yielded a dose-dependent additive effect while CDDP and BCNU had additive effect only when tumor cells were treated at IC75 of each agent. A decline in the combination effect of CDDP and BCNU at IC50 was due to decreased activity of telomerase in treated tumor cells prior to the hTERT/rev-caspase-6 transfer. On the other hand TMZ or IR had no significant additive effect on induction of apoptosis. These results suggest that agents which induce apoptosis without inhibiting telomerase activity are a promising counterpart to combine with hTERT/rev-caspase-6 therapy for the management of malignant gliomas.,,S ,,NA,,Is this publication relevent to this project?,

In this study we explored the most effective schedule of the miR-21 inhibitor (miR-21i) and Temozolomide (TMZ) combined treatment in human glioma cells. Three tumor cell lines U251 phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) mutant LN229 (PTEN wild-type) and U87 (PTEN loss of function) were subjected to evaluate the antitumor effects of deigned treatments (a predose of miR-21i for 4/8 h and then a subsequent TMZ treatment a predose of TMZ for 4/8 h and then a subsequent miR-21i treatment or a concomitant treatment) in vitro. A synergistic antiproliferative and proapoptotic activity was only obtained in U251 and U87 cells when a predose was administered for 4 h before the treatment of the other therapeutic agent while the best antitumor effect in LN229 cells was achieved by using the concomitant treatment. Our data indicate that the effect of sequence and timing of administration is dependent on the PTEN status of cell lines. The best suppression effect was achieved by a maximal inhibition of STAT3 and phosphorylated STAT3 in PTEN loss of function cells. Our results reveal that both the sequence and the timing of administration are crucial in glioma combination therapy.,,Chunsheng ,,10.1021/mp3002039,,Is this publication relevent to this project?,
ef4c236e-2376-4ad3-bc07-6741f75b6eb0,Regulation of Integrated Stress Response Sensitizes U87MG Glioblastoma Cells to Temozolomide Through the Mitochondrial Apoptosis Pathway,2018,Glioblastomas are the most frequently diagnosed and worst primary malignancy of the central nervous system with very poor prognosis. The first-line antiglioma drug temozolomide shows decreasing therapeutic efficacy as treatment progresses. As the integrated stress response (ISR) may be a resistance factor and severe stress might transform the protective effect of the ISR into a damage effect pharmacological regulation of ISR may be an effective way to sensitize glioma to temozolomide. The aim of the present study was to investigate the mechanisms of the ISR in regulating the therapeutic effect of temozolomide in the human glioblastoma multiforme cell line U87MG. Cultured U87MG cells were treated with temozolomide and PCR array was used to screen key factors in the response to treatment. Cells were co-treated with temozolomide and the eIF2 alpha phosphatase inhibitor salubrinal and cell apoptosis was measured. Combination treatment with temozolomide and salubrinal had a synergistic effect on cell viability. Salubrinal could upregulate the expression of ATF4 a key factor in the ISR and enhance temozolomide-induced apoptosis. ATF4 transcriptionally regulated expression of the BH3-ONLY protein NOXA thus inducing mitochondrial apoptosis. These findings suggest that ISR and ATF4 are involved in the death crosstalk between the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria and might be a potential target to enhance the therapeutic effect of temozolomide in patients with glioblastoma multiforme.

Salvianolic acid B (SalB) a bioactive compound isolated from Radix Salviae has been shown to exert anti-cancer effects in many cancer cell lines including glioma. This study aimed to investigate whether SalB could affect response to radiation in human glioma cells. We found that SalB decreased cell viability of U87 cells in a-dose-dependent manner. A subthreshold dose of SalB at 0.5 mu M which had no effect on cell viability and apoptosis significantly increased radiation sensitivity of U87 cells in a dose-and time-dependent manner but had no effect on sensitivity to temozolomide (TMZ). Similar results were also observed in human glioma U373 cells. In addition SalB aggravated the radiation-induced apoptosis and mitochondrial dysfunction as measured by mitochondrial Ca2+ buffering capacity and mitochondrial swelling. SalB treatment markedly promoted mitochondrial fission and differently regulated the expression of fission proteins. Furthermore downregulation of the fission protein Fis-1 using siRNA was found to partially reversed the SalB-induced effects on cell viability apoptosis and mitochondrial fission in U87 cells. In conclusion our results suggest that a subthreshold dose of SalB renders glioma cells more sensitive to radiation via Fis-1-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction and radiotherapy combined with SalB might be a novel treatment for glioma patients.,,Mao-De ,,10.1016/j.biopha.2018.08.113,,Is this publication relevent to this project?,
f27f764e-9633-441b-89eb-2241b93513de,Autophagy mediates glucose starvation-induced glioblastoma cell quiescence and chemoresistance through coordinating cell metabolism cell cycle and survival,2018,Metabolic reprogramming is pivotal to sustain cancer growth and progression. As such dietary restriction therapy represents a promising approach to starve and treat cancers. Nonetheless tumors are dynamic and heterogeneous populations of cells with metabolic activities modulated by spatial and temporal contexts. Autophagy is a major pathway controlling cell metabolism. It can downregulate cell metabolism leading to cancer cell quiescence survival and chemoresistance. To understand treatment dynamics and provide rationales for better future therapeutic strategies we investigated whether and how autophagy is involved in the chemo-cytotoxicity and -resistance using two commonly used human glioblastoma (GBM) cell lines U87 and U251 together with primary cancer cells from the GBM patients. Our results suggest that autophagy mediates chemoresistance through reprogramming cancer cell metabolism and promoting quiescence and survival. Further unbiased transcriptome profiling identified a number of clinically relevant pathways and genes strongly correlated with TCGA data. Our analyses have not only reported many well-known tumor players but also uncovered a number of genes that were not previously implicated in cancers and/or GBM. The known functions of these genes are highly suggestive. It would be of high interest to investigate their potential involvement in GBM tumorigenesis progression and/or drug resistance. Taken together our results suggest that autophagy inhibition could be a viable approach to aid GBM chemotherapy and combat drug resistance.,,Zhengliang ,,10.1038/s41419-017-0242-x,,Is this publication relevent to this project?,

Result(s): Enhanced inhibitory effects of the combination treatment were observed on cell viability expression of cell survival proteins EGFR pERK p-AKT c-myc and MT-MMP1 and increased expression of the tumor suppressor p-p53. Combination treatment also induced arrest in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. A shift in the metabolic phenotype of cells from glycolytic to oxidative phosphorylation was observed on combination treatment and the permeabilized cells showed a significant impairment in complex IV activity.

Small molecule EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as erlotinib (Tarceva) have shown some activity in a subset of glioma patients in recent trials although the reported data on the cellular basis of glioma cell responsiveness to these compounds have been contradictory. Here we have used a panel of human glioma cell lines including cells with amplified or mutant EGFR to further characterize the cellular effects of EGFR inhibition with erlotinib. Dose-response and cellular growth assays indicate that erlotinib reduces cell proliferation in all tested cell lines without inducing cytotoxic effects. Flow cytometric analyses confirm that EGFR inhibition does not induce apoptosis in glioma cells leading to cell cycle arrest in G(1). Interestingly erlotinib also prevents spontaneous multicellular tumour spheroid growth in U87MG cells and cooperates with sub-optimal doses of temozolomide (TMZ) to reduce multicellular tumour spheroid growth. This cooperation appears to be schedule-dependent since pre-treatment with erlotinib protects against TMZ-induced cytotoxicity whereas concomitant treatment results in a cooperative effect. Cell cycle arrest in erlotinib-treated cells is associated with an inhibition of ERK and Akt signaling resulting in cyclin D1 downregulation an increase in p27(kip1) levels and pRB hypophosphorylation. Interestingly EGFR inhibition also perturbs Rho GTPase signaling and cellular morphology leading to Rho/ROCK-dependent formation of actin stress fibres and the inhibition of glioma cell motility and invasion.,,Priam ,,10.1371/journal.pone.0038770,,Is this publication relevent to this project?,

Galbanic acid a natural sesquiterpene coumarin has shown favorable effects on cancerous cells in previous studies. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present work was to evaluate the effects of galbanic acid on proliferation migration and apoptosis of the human malignant glioblastoma (U87) cells. METHODS: Anti-proliferative activity of the compound was determined by MTT assay. Cell cycle alterations and apoptosis were analyzed via flow cytometry. Action on cell migration was evaluated by scratch assay and gelatin zymography. Quantitative Real-Time PCR was used to determine the expression of genes involved in cell migration (matrix metalloproteinases MMPs) and survival (the pathways of PI3K/Akt/mTOR and WNT/β-catenin). Alteration in the level of protein Akt was determined by Western blotting. RESULTS: Galbanic acid significantly decreased cell proliferation inhibited cell cycle and stimulated apoptosis of the glioblastoma cells. Also it could decrease migration capability of glioblastoma cells which was accompanied by an inhibition in the activity and expression of MMP2 and MMP9. While galbanic acid reduced the gene expression of Akt mTOR and PI3K and increased the PTEN expression it had no significant effect on WNT β-catenin and APC genes. Also the protein level of p-Akt decreased after treatment with galbanic acid. The effects of galbanic acid were observed at concentrations lower than those of temozolomide. CONCLUSION: Galbanic acid decreased proliferation cell cycle progression and survival of glioblastoma cells through inhibiting PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. This compound also reduced migration capability of the cells by suppressing the activity and expression of MMPs.,,Ahmad ,,10.2174/1874467213666200512075507,,Is this publication relevent to this project?,

The present study was undertaken to determine whether the cytotoxicity of curcumin (diferuloylmethane) a natural polyphenolic compound isolated from turmeric (Curcuma longa Linn) in glioblastoma cells is mediated through upregulation of miR-146a. Human U-87 MG glioblastoma cells were treated with curcumin and temozolomide (TMZ) alone or in combination and cell proliferation and apoptosis were assessed. The involvement of miR-146a and NF-kappa B signaling in curcumin-mediated chemosensitization was explored. Curcumin exposure led to upregulation of miR-146a in U-87 MG cells. Combined curcumin and TMZ treatment significantly (P<0.05) inhibited U-87 MG cell proliferation and induced apoptotic death compared with each alone. Notably curcumin-mediated enhancement of TMZ-induced apoptosis was blocked by depletion of miR-146a. By contrast miR-146a overexpression enhanced apoptosis and suppressed NF-kappa B activation in TMZ-treated cells. Additionally pharmacological inhibition of NF-kappa B signaling significantly increased TMZ-induced apoptosis. To the best of our knowledge the present study provides the first evidence that upregulation of miR-146a and inactivation of NF-kappa B signaling mediates the sensitization of human glioblastoma cells to TMZ-induced apoptosis by curcumin.,,Zhi-Fei ,,10.3892/mmr.2015.4087,,Is this publication relevent to this project?,
fc16244b-242b-4590-95f4-96cdc2b1842e,The Effect of Ascorbic Acid over the Etoposide- and Temozolomide-Mediated Cytotoxicity in Glioblastoma Cell Culture: A Molecular Study,2018,AIM: Glioblastoma (GBM) is one of the lethal central nervous system tumors. One of the widely used chemical agents for the treatment of glioblastoma is temozolomide. It is an orally administered deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) alkylating agent. DNA alkylation triggers the death of tumor cells. However some tumor cells are able to repair this type of DNA damage and thus lower the therapeutic effect of temozolomide. Laboratory and clinical studies indicate that temozolomide's anticancer effects might be strengthened when combined with other chemotherapeutic agents like etoposide or antioxidant agents like ascorbic acid. In this study we aimed to evaluate the cytotoxic and oxidative stress effects of ascorbic acid (1000 mu M) temozolomide (100 mu M) and etoposide (25 mu M) agents alone and in dual and triple combinations in a glioblastoma U87 MG cell culture. MATERIAL and METHODS: The cytotoxic and oxidative stress effects were investigated by the 3-(45-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-25-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) and liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis methods. RESULTS: Cytotoxicity tests showed that etoposide temozolomide [']etoposide+ascorbic acid['] [']temozolomide+ascorbic acid['] [']temozolomide+etoposide['] and [']temozolomide+etoposide+ascorbic acid['] combinations have anti-proliferative effects.

Similarly LCMS/MS analyses showed that minimum oxidative DNA damage occurred in the [']temozolomide+etoposide+ascorbic acid[']-added group.

In the present study the authors report the mechanism by which CQ enhances the therapeutic efficacy of TMZ to aid future studies aimed at improving this therapeutic regimen. METHODS: Using in vitro and in vivo experiments the authors determined the mechanism by which CQ enhances TMZ cytotoxicity. They focused on the inhibition-of-autophagy mechanism of CQ by knockdown of the autophagy-associated proteins or treatment with autophagy inhibitors. This mechanism was tested using an in vivo model with subcutaneously implanted U87MG tumors from mice treated with CQ in combination with TMZ. RESULTS: Knockdown of the autophagy-associated proteins (GRP78 and Beclin) or treatment with the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyl adenine (3-MA) blocked autophagosome formation and reduced CQ cytotoxicity suggesting that autophagosome accumulation precedes CQ-induced cell death. In contrast blocking autophagosome formation with knockdown of GRP78 or treatment with 3-MA enhanced TMZ cytotoxicity suggesting that the autophagy pathway protects from TMZ-induced cytotoxicity. CQ in combination with TMZ significantly increased the amounts of LC3B-II (a marker for autophagosome levels) CHOP/GADD-153 and cleaved PARP (a marker for apoptosis) over those with untreated or individual drug-treated glioma cells. These molecular mechanisms seemed to take place in vivo as well. Subcutaneously implanted U87MG tumors from mice treated with CQ in combination with TMZ displayed higher levels of CHOP/GADD-153 than did untreated or individual drug-treated tumors. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together these results demonstrate that CQ blocks autophagy and triggers endoplasmic reticulum stress thereby increasing the chemosensitivity of glioma cells to TMZ.,,C ,,10.3171/2014.9.FOCUS14504,,Is this publication relevent to this project?,
fc8c2050-632d-4bcd-8a18-6071fe57e363,MiR-519a enhances chemosensitivity and promotes autophagy in glioblastoma by targeting STAT3/Bcl2 signaling pathway,2018,Background: Chemoresistance to temozolomide (TMZ) is a major challenge in the treatment of glioblastoma (GBM). We previously found that miR-519a functions as a tumor suppressor in glioma by targeting the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3)-mediated autophagy oncogenic pathway. Here we investigated the effects of miR-519a on TMZ chemosensitivity and autophagy in GBM cells. Furthermore the underlying molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways were explored. Method(s): In the present study two stable TMZ-resistant GBM cell lines were successfully generated by exposure of parental cells to a gradually increasing TMZ concentration. After transfecting U87-MG/TMZ and U87-MG cells with miR-519a mimic or inhibitor a series of biochemical assays such as MTT apoptosis and colony formation were performed to determine the chemosensitive response to TMZ. The autophagy levels in GBM cells were detected by transmission electron microscopy LC3B protein immunofluorescence and Western blotting analysis. Stable knockdown and overexpression of miR-519a in GBM cells were established using lentivirus. A xenograft nude mouse model and in situ brain model were used to examine the in vivo effects of miR-519a. Tumor tissue samples were collected from 48 patients with GBM and were used to assess the relationship between miR-519a and STAT3 expression. Result(s): TMZ treatment significantly upregulated miR-519a in U87-MG cells but not in U87-MG/TMZ cells. Moreover the expression of miR-519a and baseline autophagy levels was lower in U87-MG/TMZ cells as compared to U87-MG cells. miR-519a dramatically enhanced TMZ-induced autophagy and apoptotic cell death in U87-MG/TMZ cells while inhibition of miR-519a promoted TMZ resistance and reduced TMZ-induced autophagy in U87-MG cells. Furthermore miR-519a induced autophagy through modification of STAT3 expression. The in vivo results showed that miR-519a can enhance apoptosis and sensitized GBM to TMZ treatment by promoting autophagy and targeting the STAT3/Bcl-2/Beclin-1 pathway. In human GBM tissues we found an inverse correlation between miR-519a and STAT3 expression. Conclusion(s): Our results suggested that miR-519a increased the sensitivity of GBM cells to TMZ therapy. The positive effects of miR-519a may be mediated through autophagy. In addition miR-519a overexpression can induce autophagy by inhibiting STAT3/Bcl-2 pathway. Therefore a combination of miR-519a and TMZ may represent an effective therapeutic strategy in GBM.Copyright © 2018 The Author(s).,,T ,,10.1186/s13045-018-0618-0,,Is this publication relevent to this project?,
